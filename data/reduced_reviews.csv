46-J3Ht5rxoJkXBzzoLEfA,_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,jSwaxW5ywKD4GM-EGvlDtw,2,Picked up a quick cappuccino as I attended a work meeting in the building. It took longer than expected (particularly since it wasn't overly busy) but they did manage to provide me with what I wanted. The cappuccino was underwhelming with the coffee being very strong for no discernible reason. I dislike having to put more sugar to compensate for this as it adds on the calories.
46-J3Ht5rxoJkXBzzoLEfA,pEzb9RfmnD2zn5wUPpdmzg,wH08sviT5uiqyQoz2gCW7g,2,Lattes d'hiver sont arrivés ! Guimauve grillée & canne en bonbons. Menthe & chocolat ! mmm..Par contre; cette location est vraiment bof. Le décor est joli; mais c'est très achalandé; et les pâtisseries goûtent le carton.
46-J3Ht5rxoJkXBzzoLEfA,9fe41Vmw245Eho1PghHHKw,hBkYvjGLxCLr2HWO_2Euuw,4,Easy stop at the train station. I grabbed a iced coffee; and it was fantastic. Service was nice; and the place was clean.
46-J3Ht5rxoJkXBzzoLEfA,PZftbEmXuOLopArAnuB--Q,e5MqGUqjQmjyDemFOZ4Rvg,5,I thought this place was better than Starbucks..I had cafe latte and cappuccino. Both of them were good. Their service was good too.
46-J3Ht5rxoJkXBzzoLEfA,U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,jDF7Ddrw-8Ikp9GkyPFs6A,4,I've been going to Second Cup for a while now because they make my favourite drink. They call it a Frozen Hot Chocolate (an oxymoron; I know) but recently they've been rebranding it as a FroCho (dumbest name; I know). And so now whenever I order it; I never know which to tell the barista because they never know both names...I find myself having to either repeat the name twice; or switch it out. ..It's so frustrating because Frozen Hot Chocolate was already weird to order but now it's FroCho which makes it sound like a high maintenance drink when it's not...I feel like those people who have complicated drink orders whenever I say ''I want a Frocho medium please''. ..Moral of my story is: Don't change the name of your items if they've already been established as something else...It's not really a problem but I figured I would write about it anyway...On a different note:.This location is very nice though and very convenient.
46-J3Ht5rxoJkXBzzoLEfA,3GT6dvS8YVusNGqIKBpD3w,w5ehB_TgJP_qtQ0E_KZCUQ,4,Not the nicest of the second cup chain but service always on spot like you would expect from a second cup
5K52Ebki9ezeTmFe_HPPSA,R3j9EzQCoxtv-VmNmY2x1Q,CYxN7qCmxj7D09bxK9x8cA,3,I've been to Aqua Sushi a few times for the sushis; and I have to say what you get is fine. ..The restaurant is very clean; the staff very professional and the food is fine. It is not extremely good; but it is fresh and tasty. The service is quick and attentive; while remaining discreet. you'll get to enjoy sushi while listening to Vietnamese music. Tell me about globalization! The prices are fair; and I would recommend taking their combos as they are the best price-quantity ratio. ..This place is the spot if you are looking for a quiet evening without any fuss. Relaxed and simple; this is a restaurant you come to if you are out of ideas or if you are in the area.
5K52Ebki9ezeTmFe_HPPSA,fpYMYJowa9Levq6SszNcvA,YtbqcY0pxjqp-JWqw9siZA,4,Seems like a new spot; still can smell the just finished construction inside; I was skeptical at first since the outside didn't look as good as the inside. Our group of three ordered six rolls; they come cut in slices of 5 and were rather chunky. I usually don't like chunky sushi but this was really delicious; I was really impressed with the effort put into preparation. My friend had the shrimp miso soup which had nice sized shrimp in it versus those 'cup-ol-noodles' shrimp you typically see in miso soups. I'd go again when I'm in Montreal.
5K52Ebki9ezeTmFe_HPPSA,00xGfvalJOhzGMxbqErz-A,UnjbZ7bO8ylg6kdO_VUDpw,3,Simple; clean interior. The food that I order was terrific. The sushi rolls were fresh and tasty; items on the menu cost from $3-$10. The wasabi was a bit weak in my opinion; but you can tell me when you try it...Very friendly and accommodating staff...I would go back to this place again.
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,JLdxmsngE7cjrwNT7zqgyQ,BgFsmV7kD5ZhMuWd4pmAVg,2,I've been here three times; and the staff has been great. Service is great. It's BYOW; so what's my problem??? I really want to like it; and I really want to support the St-Henri businesses; but unfortunately; all 3 times that I have been here; I found the food subpar.  ..The food has been more or less bland; and considering the prices; I wanted my seafood to be phenomenal; but it's always lacked pizazz. I've tried the Cod Balls; the Calamari; Grilled Salmon; Frittata; and the Piri-piri Chicken on my visits. The salmon was overdone; the frittata was ok; and the chicken was a bit dry. ..It was recommended to me originally by a couple that raved about the service and particularly the food; so I had to go and see what it was all about. They were right about the service; they were kind and courteous. The interior was very large; and the few times I have been there; it had been only partially full; so it was really noticeable how large the space was. It was because of that; that I didn't find the ambiance to be particularly warm or inviting. ..I'm sad to say it wasn't a hit for me.
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,D0jk146kmqeLNPN98hjFmw,5,LOVED this place ! Great quality food at a reasonable price and attentive friendly servers/staff; BYOW; warm and inviting ambiance. We tried the grilled octopus as well as a seafood stew; both were delicious. Definitely coming back !
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,tEZsTQEkZSK0RMjYZoZzZA,qGKRdrgxGKdkY4usewxkCg,3,Nice atmosphere; service was good; food was average though. Not bad; but nothing special.
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,O8rFLoRDSThqiF1yp-1ZgQ,ZqP3v6jMuB2H1lXUKa9Xkg,3,I probably would have given Bitoque four stars; but under the circumstances I had to dock them one. I'll go back to find out if they deserve that fourth one; though; because it was pretty tasty...I had a traditional striploin steak and fries with mushroom sauce. It was good; although I asked for it rare and it was definitely medium. My cousin sitting next to me asked for it medium and it was definitely well done. Tasted good; though. To start I had the sardine paté which was tasty as well...This place is BYOB only; which is cool with me 'cus we drank top-notch wines without paying the keystone vino markup...Where they fell short was on the service and overall experience. To give them credit; it was an incredibly busy night; but I'm of the opinion that a top level restaurant should staff properly and accommodate the guests it seats without compromising any aspect. Anyway; we went here with a party of 10 on December 22nd and it was packed full of other parties just like ours. Considering how crowded it was; the staff did ok; but they were definitely understaffed - like 3 servers for about 100 diners. They became flustered and service started to falter. For example; one of the young kids at our table spilled a glass of water and the waiter didn't re-set the table until we requested he do so. When he did 're-set' it; he only replaced the paper on top of the linen table cloth; so it immediately soaked through and was wet again. Other details were missed consistently throughout the night as well...Good food; decent service; unable to handle the busy holiday season; worth and try and another try.
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,NGuFeCBqy7ybtm7FBfznMQ,2,Stars for the service and the bring your own wine. Otherwise terrible...We came as a group of 12 and were well accommodated. The server was super nice and the atmosphere was also pleasant. ..The food was so disappointing. Most of us ordered the group menu that came with a soup or salad; a main and a dessert for 37$...The highlight was the soup which was actually pretty tasty. The main and dessert were so salty and just unappetizing. Even the wine couldn't salvage the experience. Way overpriced for the quality we received...The service truly was great so 2 stars for that...Service:5/5.Food:0.5/5 .Atmosphere: 3.5/5.Value:1/5
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,aBiyPYz9HE6CSz2YqfudcA,XHMJ4cJKP9W6UwexoDi5bQ,4,It is a Portuguese restaurant.  Food is pretty good quality and tasty. Service is quick as well. Went there for dinner with a large group (like party of an 18). When we arrived no bad surprise... table was ready. Only one thing that we did not plan... it is BYOB!!!! That was a pain..Over all food and location are good. But BYOB is def kinda bummer
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,ct_FaVZtLhTL1TUOP3UdKA,0H8Jr3tI4nyDUT3QxGp4gQ,5,Loved my experience at Bitoque from start to finish! It is a place to sit linger and enjoy the event that dinner should be some nights!..I ordered the lamb shank off of the table d'hote and it was fall-off-the bone delicious! I also tasted the piri-piri shrimp for the hors d'oeuvres and loved it!..The staff was lovely; the owner came and spent time with us and refilled our glasses of water. He took us around to the special events room as well!..Don't go here if you are in a rush; because its all about the experience here and it's not super quick. ..Last but not least I had the cheesecake for dessert which was incredible!
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,0ZQMbnBUpuMpf1_DiT3HyQ,hdYUh_BOPz71Pxc_8NUFRg,4,Great bring your own wine..It's a great place for a simple night out with a good experience. .Sometimes they get overwhelmed when there are too many patrons but you'll enjoy your time if you're in good company as the ambiance is warm and comfortable. .It's never empty a good bet if you don't want to spend your last dollar. Especially compared to the other restaurants in the area.
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,PNSPNmEp_ro9tX6AuLBwBA,MThwqTamc6e43PR6dvgRJA,3,Second visit for me in 4 years; now as a pescatarian. So I had the fish tapas : sardines and croquettes de morue (which I unfortunately had to return because it was wayyyy too salty). An Even-with-beer-too-salty kind of taste. .Our waiter was very nice about it though; and offered me to replace it : I opted for the grilled squids - and my taste buds were very pleased. $11 for two medium-sized mollusques; perfectly grilled with spices and a delicious white; light sauce; a lot of it. Sadly; my friend had the steak (surlonge); and struggled with it the whole time. Lots of nerves/tendons; but the cooking was good. Overall we had a good experience. Bitoque is a good value and ideal to share plates and try a bunch of different things. They serve generous portions. Oh; and bring some gum or fruity Ice Breakers lol Lots of garlic and spices but so worth it :)
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,ahPCUYw-oPWewVCMa2QcDw,r7-sbhYE5wXOvCtTU2oC4A,5,I didn't set my expectations too high as BYOW restaurants don't always have the best food but I was blown away with the service and the flavor. I had the chef's paella and my girlfriend had the flank steak. Both dishes were unique in flavor and were perfect portions. I will definitely go back.
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,fYYPmlMOy2U0Vl03m2WGlA,SSwPFnegSoZnf36ZH_1MtQ,3,Service très bon malgré que nous avions attendu longtemps pour notre plat principal. La qualité y était; très bon au goût mais j'avais encore faim après les 4 services et pourtant je n'ai pas de grande appétit.
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,wregZkyJ3efquMrnrgqGQw,KQ7Rca7Bf8n8l0iZLU-mLQ,4,This surprisingly upscale BYOB is more than worth the trip to St-Henri. The young owner who runs this amazing restaurant is one of the nicest people on the planet. The food is consistently excellent and their new chef is preparing wonders. The ambiance is warm yet cosmopolitan chic. Reservations are a must as this place is busy!
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,n6_7aH5AHlAODr6mZ0lRyA,QVp2zD5l6lokC_XpuYOhKQ,3,Un excellent Apportez votre vin! La nourriture est très bonne et le service sympatique...mais beaucoup trop lent! Nous avons même quitter avant le dessert et le café puisqu'il y avait plus de 2h30 que nous étions là! C'était un mercredi soir; et le restaurant n'était pas plein. Je n'ose imaginer un soir de week-end! Mais nous y retournerons sûrement...pour la bouffe!
6qZ7ENuqaPqwuttURXQSWg,Dp4jfn3XvZ9Xd9Ng_t7RAQ,UkFr5Ht6n5ukyOV6olrzKQ,4,Got an amazing assortment of Portuguese tapas for a very reasonable price. The atmosphere was inviting and though the place was packed; the service was excellent. The seafood was out of this world.
6suS1-FtOdwvdmAXZ5SdEw,1kHsE_TnILUZLkyVFybLSA,zXTNMPrMFg6LvIXL4V2jvQ,4,Creative vegetarian menu with lots of choices. serving breakfast. Bowls are good; can customize. Fast service for being fresh. Coffee like drinks have sugar pre mixed so minus one star.
6suS1-FtOdwvdmAXZ5SdEw,5G1LLdZNxwswR1TjMfiMig,ANuA0agIOy0QnTcVuD0V5g,5,By now you are used to reading our reviews of decadent cuisine and alcohol served throughout Montreal. But this week we decided it was time to go healthy; and what is more healthy than the nutritious plant-based powerfoods served at Copper Branch. Established in 2014; Copper Branch is a Montreal based brand with a plan to offer the best tasting vegan cuisine around. With new locations popping up all the time; they are well on their way to being a staple in Montreal neighbourhoods and in Montrealer's diets...As we head into winter; when the comfort food comes calling; we often find it difficult to stick to our diets. Now that Copper Branch is on the scene; we no longer have any excuse. Great tasting; chef-inspired; and conveniently-served plant-based meals is the new way to go. The name itself comes for the inspiration of the best type of cookware; copper; and branch comes from nature. Therefore the best cooking with nature...Copper Branch wants to bring their best to local communities by using primarily locally sourced products; and with plans to support local athletes and nutritional programs for schools. You can contact them about current and future projects at copperbranch.ca...We were invited to one of the downtown locations at 600 De Maisonnueve; situated on the street level; the locale was brightly lit and appealing. The staff was extremely attentive and have quick recommendation for every taste and appetite...As we are true foodies and are willing to try it all; we let the expert staff choose our meals for us. The Shiitaki burger was served nice and hot and wonderfully complemented by the organic teriyaki sauce and sriracha coleslaw. Perfect for a nice winter's day or to grab a quick burger on the go. Next came the Aztec Power Bowl served with organic brown rice. The bowl was a beautiful mix of Sweet potato; corn & mango salsa; black beans; pumpkin seeds; guacamole; vegan sour cream; chickpeas; broccoli; beets; turnip; lettuce;  and finally sprouted mung beans...We supplemented our meals with a Copper Branch Fuel; a divine organic cold-pressed juice; made with carrot; celery; lettuce; lemon and ginger. A little on the spicy side it was a pleasant addition to our meal. We also sampled the Blue Sky soda; a natural soda made with sugar cane. Great when you crave something sweet. We left the restaurant feeling energized and satisfied...The Copper Branch slogan is: You Are More Vegan Than You Think! But we think they should also include their mantra of Copper Branch. The Revolution Starts Here. We think they are going to revolutionize the fast food industry. Watch out Montreal; here they come.
6suS1-FtOdwvdmAXZ5SdEw,rzWK6Rqvw8_xA5RoUHd3gA,Ykci8e4imGu7SgA-Ldolmw,1,Terrible!  J'y suis allé avec une collègue pour le lunch..Commande de ma collègue : erreur sur la facture; ils lui ont chargé un brownie supplémentaire. Nous avions pris les plats pour emporter. Quand nous sommes arrivés à nos bureaux; nous nous apprêtons à déguster le tout : le pain à burger est tellement détrempé qu'il se défait par lui-même..Ma commande : D'abord; je précise que je vais prendre pour emporter; on me la sert comme plat à consommer sur place. (Ce qui de prime à bord n'est pas si tragique) mais quand je mentionne que je l'ai demandé pour emporter; on me fait une attitude de M**** en me disant : sur la facture c'est écrit pour manger ici... Finalement; on me l'emballe rapidement et on me  garoche  mes trucs; sans même me donner de sac... (Encore là vous allez me dire qu'il n'y a rien là; je suis d'accord mais; ce qui suit; est à mon avis inacceptable). J'ai pris un burger et des frites; avant de quitter; je souhaite mettre du poivre sur lesdites frites; car moi j'aime ça mettre du poivre sur mes frites et j'estime qu'à près de 20$ pour un burger et des frites si je veux du satané de poivre sur mes frites j'ai le droit d'en demander et ils se doivent de m'en fournir....Ça ben beau est un resto grano; du poivre ça ne vient pas d'un être possédant des yeux. Donc; j'en demande... On me dit  S'il en n'a pas là; c'est qu'on a n'a pas!  Fin!  Ne prennent pas la peine de me dire :  deux minutes; je vais aller voir si nous en avons derrière.... Et je tiens à dire ici; que la même attitude de M*** mentionnée ci-haut est toujours présente. (J'apprends plus tard que cette personne est en fait la super propriétaire. Pour le reste de l'histoire cette personne sera surnommée joie de vivre...Bref;  nous arrivons à nos bureaux et première bouchée : je passe près de tout recracher; car ce n'est pas ce que j'ai commandé. J'avais demandé pour le Burger aux patates douces et j'ai eu le je sais pu quoi  Burger Gala...; mais visiblement fait d'un ingrédient qui ne passe pas... Nous décidons donc de retourner sur place; car c'est impossible que je mange ce burger.  C'est Joie-de-vivre qui nous accueille. Nous lui disons ce qui cloche avec nos commandes : le pain détrempé. Pour eux c'est normal; c'est comme ça que ça vient. Point. Si ça t'écœure du pain détrempé c'est to bad. MANGE ! Tu as commandé ça; c'est ça que ta; tu perds le droit d'exprimer ton mécontentement. Donc; ma collègue a eu le droit seulement de se faire rembourser le brownie de trop qui lui avait été chargé. Moi; on me dit sur ta facture c'est écrit  burger Gala...; je m'en fou; je sais que ce n'est pas cela que j'ai demandé; car j'ai pris la peine de consulter votre menu avant de venir et dans aucune langue le mot  Patates douces  ressemble à  Gala.... . Bref; on me rembourse de peine et misère ledit burger; mais on oubli pour les frites; car c'est ce que j'ai commandé; c'est ce que j'ai; j'ai donc perdu le droit d'exprimer mon mécontentement vis-à-vis les frites (qui depuis le temps; sont pas mal rendues froides; même très froides; donc pas très mangeables). Bref; tout ça pendant qu'une manifestation à lieu; et pendant que j'attends pour le remboursement Joie-de-vivre cri après les manifestants; quand Joie-de-vivre finit de crier après les manifestants elle s'exprime sur les québécois et à quel point ce sont de mauvaises personnes et de personnes chialeuses .... Toujours au même moment; ma collègue reçoit un snapchat; le regarde et Joie-de-vivre pense qu'elle est en train de prendre une photo. Ma collègue lui dit que ce n'est pas ce qu'elle est en train de faire. Joie-de-vivre tape sur le téléphone de ma collègue; comme pour cacher l'écran. (Ma collègue va même jusqu'à lui montrer les photos qu'elle a dans son cellulaire et Joie-de-vivre lui dit carrément que c'est une menteuse). J'ai finalement mon remboursement (seulement le burger) et comme par magie il y a maintenant du poivre sur le comptoir. Vous savez le poivre qu'il n'avait pas quelques minutes plus tôt. J'Imagine que Joie-de-vivre est sorti en acheter entre nos deux visites. Bref; je suis très souvent dans les restos;  et j'en ai eu des histoires étranges et de mauvais services; mais celui-ci gagne haut la main la médaille d'or !
6suS1-FtOdwvdmAXZ5SdEw,Rb6zIg_LOovNrdr0U7WYRA,XDhH3k2FZbS2VtCdA98FMw,3,Do not eat here at lunch - it's just too busy and too small to accommodate a lineup. The staff seems to get very overwhelmed if there are too many orders placed. I waited over 25 minutes today for the wrong order. Very disappointed when I got back to my desk - and a half-full box at that (which had happened before). I love the food here though; and it's a nice veggie option to have downtown. The scrambled tofu on the Aztec bowl is a great pick. Advice: eat here; in-house (where they are likely to fill up your bowl to a visibly reasonable amount) - and avoid lunchtime lineups!
6suS1-FtOdwvdmAXZ5SdEw,oIgnbSgc6YpYjM3dZKH0Ww,t8WTB0NyuVYxUT0aOxsyUA,4,Il y a plusieurs succursales de ce restaurant fast food vegan. Je préfère personnellement La Panthère verte pour ce genre de resto mais j'ai ma carte fidélité Copper Branch car je crois qu'il faut encourager tous ces restos vegan. Un peu cher mais très bon.
6suS1-FtOdwvdmAXZ5SdEw,RZUrmsaUiFKmZQvxuuk4UQ,drgrr-atmVZiNCFbz7hT_Q,3,I visited this place for lunch at the Robert Bourassa street. Tried their salad meal. It was good but nothing unusual. It is a good place for a veggie but not offers much belonged salads and usual sandwiches. I liked the smoothies offered by them though; with unusual names. Tried the budhdha smoothie and liked it. The place does not have a warm vibe; but it is like that with most of the food chains.
6suS1-FtOdwvdmAXZ5SdEw,LM1Tv7q6s4d9dTQYFd2KrA,yp88dRPCQW3qPV61ChU34g,3,Good vegan food; which can be hard to come by: I really enjoy the teriyaki burger when they don't leave the avocado peel on the avocado that comes as an extra. Service is poor: there's a manager-type who seems to frequently have to take over for other staff who are kind of lacking in customer service skills. It's not cheap either; but given the nutritional value; that's all right by me.
6suS1-FtOdwvdmAXZ5SdEw,lxaBfy6snoCHWtN5KPrZtw,IRVAaBKkaxYlUnPOFBzwBg,4,Good and fast place. Nice that it's vegan so you can get a fast meal and at least feel like you're hitting your diet goals.
6suS1-FtOdwvdmAXZ5SdEw,88UG99StS5MRnx4SCaoXVA,hXrgE6Xp6WZjSQz2oXISAA,4,The waffles are to die for. First; they are GLUTEN FREE. They really need to get this in Flordia.
6suS1-FtOdwvdmAXZ5SdEw,D2_16NeralE4Tdjw9cToHQ,Ty1ZIEU6cL-dffnEvEcO8A,1,The owner is an awful person. He screamed at a friend telling her: Go back to your country because she accidentally let her tray in the wrong place. She insulted her several times and screamed at her. Left her in tears for no reason. I wouldn't go to a place like this ever. What kind of service is this? Unbelievable.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,qcHl1SOGgbuJn0i1l1fWSg,Y3wnD7wepl5mgGSePmSmwQ,3,Good BBQ; filling portion; but not huge. No sauce provided at the table. Friendly owner. Service was really off; but I expect it was because they were understaffed. Nice seating area outside. Could use a wipe down; though.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,Fub4xKExRbfmg2NVhPqWjw,SKE-9T1D3APZpuS2PtG3pw,5,This place is great. Vicky was an awesome waitress. Very kind and respectful. Best place I've been in Montreal
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,oiiiF9oC2R_JCtiqZUwlTQ,5r12klkfJRXUlgqOhGHX1w,5,Wow!  The fried smoked chicken was worth the trip.  Great southern food; cooked right; north of the border.  Great service.  Perfect atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,h1UcaSPIPpQqMiWf12Csqw,HhRQRNa6PeMzOHBwhuWlbQ,3,This place was average.  I liked the sangria and the deep fried pickles. Also; the chicken wings are huge.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,Gkxe9U9E2WR2937cjIZboA,A2y58-s1hhTVfp_rxbP1nQ,1,Not very good; there was no BBQ sauce or mustard or any other BBQ stuff; hot sauce etc... On the table or bottles to buy and bring home. The portions are too small and everything was very oily?? Not in a fun greasy bbq way; more in the way someone was in the back going nuts putting oil all over the dishes so nothing sticks. The food seems very uninspired. ..I would recommend this place if you have never left Montreal or eaten BBQ anywhere else. I receive the impression that this place is catering more towards St. Laurent downtown crowd; gluten free blah blah and low carb what not; which is a very city approach to BBQ. Sandwiches were light on meat and heavy on buns and coleslaw. All the unique signature only here BBQ side dishes may as well come from a grocery store; coleslaw; potato salad; maquechoux; were all very bland; boring; very oily and not very flavorful. There was no hot sauce; BBQ sauce or spices anywhere and no ability to add any myself. ..It seems like a good place for drinks; maybe lunch. If you are looking for a saucy; meaty; BBQ pigout you should keep looking.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,hg3oFUDIyEehsgYDXYNqEg,frc9l9-MD3aXWZpEqtKKYg,1,Waited an hour for service and food was cold...Waitress was forgetting the orders etc.....Bad experience
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,RMopAcH2eoiOuPkStfg_YQ,6wD5CHMtEcvajPVWRcZJuw,5,I went to Diablos for the first time today; and tbh I wasn't a big ribs fan; but after trying the ribs in Diablo ( as my friend is in love with it); I would say they got me; I'm a fan now! It's ribs with BBQ sauce; comes with great fries; and if you want an extra side. We got mashed potatoes which was different; but yet delicious. The ribs are very big; so it's also good to share it...They also have a nice terrace with a St-Laurent view; so it's a nice spot for the summer.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,yL926hqxYO5BgBFx31YvKA,u1_Wl9rh9oOaBd1uUrpN7A,1,This is not proper BBQ of any sort!  Wings lack any flavor whatsoever.  Brisket and chicken combo is a joke- 1/4 inch slice of cold brisket with 50% fat content and undercooked chicken smothered in bottled BBQ sauce with liquid smoke is not edible!  Don't waste your money...
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,BABesE-pv2h9oEXXSy7XjA,EVA_-OEDE616FZLLHD6Zpw,2,Good service; decent poutine. Pork ribs were not falling of the bone; a little chewy and too much fat. Beef ribs were not as fatty but same chewy experience.   Brisket was good but you had to cut your way through too much fat ....fattiest I've ever had. The portion looked large upon first sight thus disappointing. The onion stack rings were brutal...very dry and over cooked. Was excited upon arrival; left disappointed.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,HMNA_R_Bu1G3Ho2BBoB3Lg,YDDOoQvfjmjPuMN1ks3nZw,1,I would give this a zero if i could. .We show up as a group of 5 people to a half empty restaurant; ask if they have place for us; which they obviously do. The absolutely lost waiter talks to us; says he'll see what he can do; starts roaming around and then disappears out of sight. Reappears several minutes later just to give us this you are still here look and then says they don't have room for 5 people. No; they can not put two of these tables together. Me and my friends left dumbfounded. Surely enough we found another place to eat and surely enough none of us is ever setting a foot in this place. Make sure you are no more than 4 when you attempt to visit this joint. Or better go elsewhere where they want your money
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,wQ635cP5VEaEGimkcSedwQ,byRYBorSvIIE-3xyh0KgNA,4,This is the first restaurant that me and my friends ate at when we arrived in Montreal. As Americans used to subpar Tex-Mex chain restaurants; Diablos exceeded our expectations. Their menu is extensive and has something for everyone. Although the prices seem expensive; the portion sizes are very large. I had the fried chicken; which comes with Cajun fries and cornbread...did not disappoint! I wish I got to try more of their cocktails because the drink menu seemed to offer a lot of quirky cocktails.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,0KZNZKVCTpURutG_qbMKzg,76Ak9BwUadJz9XWhuiUuKA,4,Amazing ribs; friendly staff; and great drinks!The fries were well seasoned the meat on the ribs fall right off the bone.The only thing that my friend and i disliked was that the sauce was too sweet and believe me: I love a sweet bbq sauce but this one was too sweet. I also noticed the ribs were not that marinated. I tried a piece without any sauce and all i could taste was the smoke but there was no actual flavor to the ribs. Maybe a little salt and pepper before smoking them would help?
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,W-Dl-2cio049XM26Q8HuqA,Mv6IhuXJJweBnAPrnReLuQ,4,Food was good had a good time drinks were nice as well!!.They also have a terrace which is a plus..Service was good they were very nice will go back for sure
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,iZGth1YCJwN-D2vIqPWcYw,sWts8_THXVIvkWrKC0-QJQ,5,One of our must go to restaurants when visiting Montreal. It's on a super cool street with plenty to see. .The food is AMAZING! Best ribs in Montreal that we've tried. This time we also got the burnt ends; and they were even better than expected. My girlfriend said they were one of the best things she's ever eaten; and actually hasn't stopped talking about them. .The maque choux was also really really good! The beans were a bit spicy; but tasted awesome; and was a very tasty hot. .As always; a great meal and great experience
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,hQ_xPEuW6BCbiIf4qq6N0Q,L49OvkVUBlWwc-xKOemZKg,1,Beyond bad. Keep walking. ..Ordered a pulled pork sandwich on the pretzel bun; and my BF ordered the brisket sandwich (on same bun); both with the spicy cajun fries. SPOILER ALERT: not at all spicy. ..We were both so hungry that no comments were made while we both experienced our lukewarm; soggy; stale sandwiches knowing that we paid too much for them. ..Oh well.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,sDWTdKtPRuqfMEtv2rIx4A,3,Recently had supper at Diablos with a group of friends. Nice ambiance and good service. .We went quite early 6;30 and the resto was quiet....would recommend later supper as it picks up around 8pm. Food was okay at best. Had the rib plate with fries which was okay at best.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,RV_XUmbj0Tb7p4BBtMQ2mw,DvTZdaLQG-8Jidl92Zc4MQ,1,This place is disgusting!!! Rude staff! Service is terrible. ..Asked for jalapeño poppers; on the menu it states jalapeños stuffed with cream cheese and Panko....came to the table stuffed with pork! When we complained; that we do not eat pork; MANAGEMENT SAID THEY SHOULD NOT BE EATING HERE. ..Honestly; how is that your business model? Even the waitress said this is not the first that it's happened. Many have complained; yet the menu remains the same...unchanged to disclose the pork aspect. WHY??? ..If I were a resident; and not just a visitor from the states; this would be a LAWSUIT. Totally disgusted. .DO NOT EAT HERE! This place has zero respect.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,viJCnSjDyrWBmJlY_yASEg,fFAZMDWCLjOEiNfDtFdE2Q,2,Testé uniquement le midi; les ribs étaient secs; arrosés de sauce barbecue pour sauver l'ensemble; mais ça ne m'a pas convaincu...dommage; moi qui m'attendais à manger les meilleurs côtes levées de la ville...
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,vXmp8RDGBDxJFRlueMei7g,x7KovGvB6bT23dAv-dVEpg,3,Visited during Grand Prix so it was busy - service was slow but ok. Delicious shrimp Po-boy sandwich and terrible poutine. Amazing cocktail selection though for reasonable prices. Worth a try
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,vYO8z_f4aVjmxRpwCrMicA,XK6D_X3k-LA2q9RJxxXlZQ,2,L'expérience commence sur une mauvaise note... Je dois demander à changer mon verre de bière; parsemé de taches graisseuses. .Ensuite; mon sandwich de porc effiloché est sec et froid. Le serveur m'explique que c'est parce que la sauce est conservée au frigo... Merci pour l'explication! La salade de pommes de terre choisie en accompagnement n'a aucune saveur..Ma copine a commandé une poutine fumée. Sauce goûteuse; mais hyper salée; fromage bien frais; frites acceptables; mais encore ici; un problème de température : elle était déjà tiède lorsqu'elle est arrivée à notre table. .On y retournera jamais.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,6RQVjXnBlrj_J1H9O1JXIg,DUTFTPDXOvNGU6nrR7TIlA,5,Awesome experience; we got there by random choice; but were greatly surprised by the food taste and friendly staff! I took the smoked  brisket which was delicious! I'll get back there and bring all my friends!!.Thank you guys !!
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,hdeHN0k81jCS-J-XoJKW_w,ZuVGztgVkiz39CkL9AINHg,5,Went there on a cold Tuesday in February. Ordered the beef brisket with (spicy) baked beans and coleslaw. Friends had beef short rib and Mac n Cheese. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals!  Brisket was tender and flavorful with just the right amount of spice and sauce. Our waiter turned out to be the owner. Bonus!  So; we got a great education on Louisiana style (he used to live there pre-Katrina) cooking and an even better education on Bourbon!  You can't leave without trying one of their multiple selections. I would definitely go back!
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,4VcNcubHO-5aeXPySyxPUg,XJ68lFnppmB_dvKn-Xn0pg,2,I wish I had caught our servers name; but we were here Sunday night and she was an absolute rock star. Truly one of the best servers I've ever had. But the sad thing I was able to watch so much of her handiwork was simply this sad fact: this is not a functional restaurant (and she saves this from being a one-star review). ..We arrived here with a group of eight with an OpenTable reservation. That reservation was absolutely meaningless. Not because the restaurant was full; but because there was no one there to seat us. We were polite and stood at the Please let us seat you; sign for far too long before seating ourselves. We noticed that only one of the many seated tables had food and it was at that point that it became clear that there was only one server. At this point; had I been by myself or with a smaller party; I would have left; but since we were such a large group and I was there for the company; we stuck it out. ..The server was so apologetic and did her absolute best; but we waited for menus; for drinks; and for food for a crazy amount of time. They were out of chicken; hush puppies; and a few other menu items. They only had light versions of the beers that were ordered. ..The food: perfectly in line with yelp's two-star standard quote of meh; I've experienced better. But the server split the large group check perfectly for our individual orders; and that; to be honest; is no small miracle and we were thankful for it. ..All in all; if the restaurant matched the quality of our server; this would be quite the dinner spot.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,G-UGgrbHEhwjqluWU_1c0Q,3,We were looking for a place to grab dinner and decided to give this place a go - admittedly because the decor looked pretty cool...We sat on the terrace; and ordered a shrimp po'boy and a brisket on pretzel bun. The food took quite some time to come out. The menu did mention (as a cautionary?) that Diablos BBQ was not a fast food joint; and therefore time should be given for proper food preparation. Still; we felt that the main reason was understaffing; as the only waiter running around was obviously overloaded...The meal itself was delicious; but portions were way too small. The food lacked the oomph factor typically associated with southern BBQ; which is well known for gigantic racks of meat and other generous cuts. I guess it was a good thing because we were supposed to eat healthy that week; but what is a cheat day without overeating?..Good food (wonderful cornbread!); but a bit disappointing for the aforementioned reasons.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,3MQsxciz7ASf0Y4s6Gkv8g,0zWnwWF6COwvvapaGOrrGQ,5,Fantastic food with friendly staff. Deliciously slow cooked food for BBQ and spice lovers. Great selection of beers and cocktails
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,cv1xkV09manKvs08nbLN-A,n8dOCL5CQf5K3J5LuJCupg,4,Came here on a Saturday night; with 4 adults and 2 small kids. We had made reservations ahead of time via Bookenda (they were unable to find it); but they accommodated anyway. When I made the reservation; they made me aware that they did not have high chairs. Which wasn't terrible; just slightly annoying (I found out that most places in Montreal are like this)..Clearly I was a tourist. We chose this place because it seemed the most family friendly; with great food. The food was truly delicious; we ordered The Dixie Normous and it fed 4 of us adults perfectly. ..The drinks on the other hand were ok. Nothing amazing. We ordered a Sangria pitcher; and 2 old fashioned's. Considering I live in the states; their bourbon list was pretty decent. You can't go wrong with bourbon. Except I asked them for an Old Fashioned; and it was incomplete...Overall; a great BBQ place.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,rLh63PoxknAV52w5IkmcQA,eyRjLscci-vqggq5MfDkjg,3,I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars for this one...The BBQ is great. We got the Dixie for 2 people; pulled pork; fried chicken; brisket and ribs; cornbread and mash with a side Mac and cheese and extra biscuits. .The meat was excellent; zero complaints; it was just damn good bbq. The cornbread was really nice. I find the biscuits to be a bit too salty; the Mac and cheese alright; a bit bland. Mash has a lot of pepper. ..My friends got tacos. This seemed silly to me. Go to a taco place for tacos; have BBQ and the smokehouse. They weren't great tacos. ..The lower rating was partly because of that (but what do you expect?) but mostly because of the service. It started great. Apps came out quick; so did drinks. Our 4th dinner mate was a bit late; and once he arrived; service was very slow. The restaurant is small; and it wasn't full; but our 4th has to wait a long time for a drink; food came out somewhat quickly; we ordered dessert and asked for the bill immediately because we had a show to get to; the bills came; but it took forever for dessert. We were about to walk out the door without it when they stopped us and said they would prepare it to go; which took a few more minutes. ..All in all; I would go here again; but not if I was in a rush to be somewhere else after dinner.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,wwzJf0zd9cMEl-Se-yZ_rA,9EbZWEB_-MVOHlw8FX-6tw,5,We ate at the bar on a semi-busy Friday; and service was quick and attentive.  My exposure to barbecue is limited to Dinosaur BBQ and Limp Lizard in Syracuse NY; so by no means an expert; just a regular schmoe hunkering for a dose of gout-inducing (this is a compliment); mouth watering animal protein turned succulent main course. Diablo's beef brisket and pork barbecue didn't disappoint. It was so good; we ordered another half rack of the pork ribs. Many napkins were killed in the eating process as the ghost pepper hot sauce kept the salivary glands pumping. Will come back again.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,ZILWY9g_wagehXtx9GzMDA,FhSZIotmRv1BdNwx9zTS6w,3,First off; props to the waiter who was all on his own for the whole restaurant. I did not wait long for my food; but getting my check took long and I sat with an empty glass for quite a while. The food was just ok; the potato salad was really displeasing;but being from the south; I may just be used to more salty/ fattening cuisine. The waiter convinced me to get my old fashioned smoked not overly impressed; but to each his own.
6WDaq9fe39J1THiWI19p9g,D2QJTUZp6-se0cs7EYmcWQ,3OIUdbdMS8OQ-8Ud5QuKXA,1,Here's why we gave up without having eaten anything after waiting for two and a half hours.....I get that our first visit was on Christmas. I was expecting slower service likely due to being understaffed and being one of the only restaurants open outside of Chinatown. ..-we made a reservation and was seated rather quickly. .- we waited 20 minutes until we had to flag down someone just to take our drink order. .-we waited another 30 minutes just to get those drinks..-60 minutes in; our 6 year old was hungry; we asked if they could bring a piece of bread.or anything to tide her over. They could not..-1.5 hours in; my husband had to go to the dep to get our child a snack because her stomach hurt from hunger.- many tables had come; eaten and left in the two hours we had waited for our appetizer..-2 hours in; we wanted to know if we were getting food; the manager checked the kitchen and said that it was coming right up....-2.5 hours in; our appetizer finally came. It didn't have half the things described on the menu and the chicken wings were undercooked and juices were running pink..- at that point we were finished with this place and decided to leave. The manager told us that the smoking process turns the chicken pink and that we should look it up we did and if anyone's curious the flesh can be pink; but not the juices or near close to the bone..- we wished the customers beside us that had been waiting as long as us without any food either;  good luck and left...Ugh.....-
6XLvkFrnu0FJIw6i-7wPXw,OLfw94Ce5ZVp6z21D9vI4Q,ht9cAVHhf5Uk82PJYBqvZg,3,A favorite after-school place for Asian (and non-Asian) university undergraduate students at McGill...They have rather good boba here. I didn't have the chance to have any of their food; but according to the group I was with (who frequents Cactus often; apparently); it's rather good as well. It's a very typical Chinese/Taiwanese(?)-run boba shop; with games; magazines; cards; a TV playing music videos.. Free Wi-Fi; and a great atmosphere just to hang out with a group; study; or talk with a friend...Rating is subject to change once I actually taste their food. Good boba; but not enough to make me come back constantly; yet.
6XLvkFrnu0FJIw6i-7wPXw,mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,tSCftNLsECr2p_zdMwuXsQ,4,Somehow I always have suspicions over eateries in the Concordia ghetto; but I'm glad I discovered this one. Food and bubble tea are delicious; service is quick and friendly; and the place quite cosy; you can even play board games. I had the popcorn chicken with noodles and lychee green tea. For about $10; I was full and happy. It's Chinese food of the Taiwanese variety; hence not your typical Chinese restaurant. If this place was closer to home; I would definitely go there more often.
6XLvkFrnu0FJIw6i-7wPXw,52DUFbMTQ7BFTm5HlLgItw,mv_6CobcE2YbTijxaVwYfg,4,This place was a staple stop when I went to Concordia.  ..Large variety of drinks; bubbles and jellies. Never tried any of the food here but have heard that it is also quite good. ..Most memorable drink I have had here was an apple tea which was infused with fresh apple slices. Fantastic!
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,fBds1I32xbuF0oT3bLwtlg,5wsJ8gZrgkaY8nnYR38CKg,5,Beautiful cafe. Great staff! So nice. They make excellent matcha!!! Great quality. Yummy vegan desserts! I just absolutely love it!!
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,pHpKdyQ2eJFIpsIw544MiA,zz1QeBhVy9uUS6HLKXqsjg,5,Tasty vegan snacks and drinks. There's a variety of different non-dairy mills for your drinks; personally; I like the coconut milk.
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,-9b4s874f_CnznTu4JorRg,6rPIYXJaHIazlT_Dn9WNAA,5,We went there a bit by accident; we were in the neighborhood; they have a excellent coffee; and all their pastries are vegan. We took a latté; two pastries; a kombucha and a cactus everything for 15$. I will go back for sure.
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,h8xK7S1xXUBP2qXW0ZPxxA,c33kR2bSH_lRWhJ7xpl7Mw,4,This is one of those coffee shops you would expect to find on an episode of the show Girls. It caters to a young demographic that is trendy and urban. Great baked goods; coffee and friendly and bilingual service. It is very close to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and it has a modern; clean aesthetic. Not many tables but very homey and cool.
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,aOPijKnBFUBCFEwZQ2BIBA,87MdMwqrbwYL8wMFARh4zg,5,J'ai adoré mon passage à Leaves Cafe. Dès qu'on rentre dedans; on est comme apaisé; non pour vrai; le café est tranquille alors qu'on est en plein centre-ville. Je ne savais même pas qu'il était végétalien et j'ai apprécié le fait que ça ne soit pas revendiqué; que cela reste discret. ..J'ai pris un chaï latté au lait de soya et un brownie sans gluten : EXCELLENT ! La musique était parfaite; la décoration épuré et simple était vraiment belle; le service à table et la fontaine d'eau n'est qu'un détail mais c'était vraiment apprécié. Les bas prix des cafés et thés m'ont étonnés; j'y retournerai sans hésiter !..Petite suggestion : Serait-il possible d'installer des porte-manteaux pendant l'hiver et de mettre des tables un petit peu plus grand ?
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,yEgJfWRPnIzYLzELC2YN2A,74nqf3_amlNEGNyPPJUHBw,5,Made an attempt to go on the weekend while here with my work (our annual mystery trip) and made the mistake of not looking at the times; they like to sleep in on the weekend. Sadly; we ended up at a chain. ..BUT the story has a happy ending because Monday before our flight left; I made my crew go with me. I wasn't aware (maybe I can't read well) that there was no real (or lactose) milk there. If you make the mistake that I did and aren't a fan of Coconut; Soy or Almond...get OAT MILK. I had never heard of it; because I'm not trendy I guess but this stuff is so good. I had a mocha with it and I constantly think about it. They have super cute plants too; I would have bought one but was flying back to the USA and they don't let us take plants unfortunately.
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,izdAXYjPdwaztxuT6C7GvQ,5rnPr2kfKgW-Ku4YFIoj-Q,4,I would give this Cafe between 3 to 4 stars in general. 4 because of the space. Although tiny; Leaves Cafe really maximizes it's space with small tables; bar seating along the side; and a beautifully minimal aesthetic. There is ample natural lighting and some exterior seating on the sidewalk. It is a great place to sit down and read a book on a lazy afternoon in downtown Montreal. ..I would give it 2-3 stars for the coffee/food. This is a coffee store with a healthy range of drinks however they don't have any milk or dairy products because they aim to be cruelty free. While I don't mind being low impact; I really do prefer my coffees; lattes etc with milk or cream in them. You have a choice of almond milk; coconut milk or soy milk. I was recommended the coconut milk as being closest to the real deal. They do take their time to give you a strong cup of joe by making it as a pour over; however I found the coffee to be quite acidic; possibly because there was no milk in it or maybe that was just the kind of bean they had. ..Tip: there is wifi but I couldn't get it to work on my devices. ..Overall; while I love the space; I can't quite get behind non-dairy coffee based drinks so I might return for a baked good or two but not for the coffee.
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,383UDZYlbY9gaKNo7Dv9UA,urs7yXlHVgy1IckEqAZJDA,3,Très beau petit café avec ses divers cactus et plantes à vendre; ce qui explique pourquoi c'est l'un des cafés les plus Instagramable de Montréal. Bon service et personnel chaleurs. Le chocolat chaud est bon. Le seul hic de la place; est que c'est petit; donc il n'y a pas beaucoup de places quand tous les étudiants viennent étudier; mais c'est ce qui fait le charme de la place. Je conseille le Leaves Café!
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,GBHgHiYLASLNUE-bELxp0w,OO9IsLQ2R_GIviBZzzVqAw,5,It's a cute little cafe that also sells house plants! My friend Jules and I wanted a spontaneous adventure to Montreal last spring and so we hopped onto a bus of old art museum patrons and shuttled over to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. During our museum break; we wandered around the neighborhood to find a place to eat and we stumbled upon this lovely little cafe nearby. Because of my obsession with green tea I ordered a Matcha Latte and enjoyed it; all in my cute little to-go cup. I kind of wish I kept my cup for future repurposing but I guess I just have to come back to order something else..What was really striking was the shelf on the side that housed several potted plants and featured several Instagram photos. I really like this duality to the place. The plant shop obviously is referenced in the name; Leaves Cafe; and to build off that I feel like potted plants give the place a lovely and lively atmosphere. I'm enjoying new oxygen from the plants while also sipping on a warm latte. This place is definitely Insta-worthy; so come here if you want to feel like an artsy food photography blogger.
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Nm40y_ZPGYzsvH0pGezk1A,5,Absolutly adorable coffee shop with the most alluring display of cacti. Just the plants alone would have been enough to lure us into the place! Leaves Café irradiates positivity and youthfullness; with bright white walls and splashes of color.  ..The interior outline is a bit odd; as the self-service counter is squishes between the espresso machine and the wall - it must not be easy to navigate when the shop is busy! We got a latte with almond milk; which was very creamy and delicious. Two small tables and wooden benches on the pavement-side terrasse was a nice addition to the limited amount of seating area inside the coffee shop. Also; good-looking pastries!
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Ax8T1do_I-W-JTfmu2pFZw,3,I'm a big fan of the aesthetics of this café: there are plants and cacti everywhere (which you can buy; by the way!). It felt small and cramped though; and it was a bit too loud to study. You probably shouldn't expect finding a place to sit down. I personally didn't think the coconut milk paired well with the acidity of their coffee; but soy milk was better. Prices are average for an indie coffee shop; I paid 5$ for a chai latte.
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,8o5YaBnbnTJfjc7wpsiGUw,kyMGo9hd5TOvfdlFUs8Oew,4,This cafe is so cute! I love the atmosphere here. The music that plays in the background is very chill. All of their drinks are vegan; they offer almond; soy or coconut milk. I got the matcha latte with almond milk. It came to $4.75 which is pretty typical for a latte. I sat and studied here; it's a bit drafty inside. The downside is that there isn't that much space. 15-20 people could fit in here; so if you get a spot to study congratulations! Their wifi works; but isn't super fast. Some pages won't load and the spinning wheel is frequent on Macs. Most people go in and out; so you'll be able to get a spot. They have different plants and cacti that decorate the walls and fairy lights strung across the ceiling. Bring a date or bring your laptop!..I was studying here for a bit too long and got hungry. I got their almond brioche and their baked goods are from Sophie Sucree! Except for a few things like their donuts! Pretty tasty and decently priced at $3!
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,c8LIFoiJYExEQNaPi4vdHQ,lwT36bb5jFJROtP8S6l52Q,4,Very cute vegan coffee shop! Friendly service and great insta worthy aesthetics (seriously; everybody I saw there took at least a few pics of the plants and drinks; some even stood up on their chairs for that flatlay). I had a chai latte with almond milk and it was delicious.
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,bZDnJY0ToZMGx6sd7K1F_Q,3nAOZF0KEw3xuW9LUxh2HQ,5,So lovely! Used this place as an escape from a rainy afternoon after visiting the museum of fine arts. There are succulents and cactus everywhere and they lighten up the environment. Being a picky coffee drinker the Latte at Leaves did not disappoint. Recommend and would come back any time!
7EbrIfLTqQjKn320KUaDOg,PYZzrCWFo5kubqtYgAC6ag,sewYe3ayOPwEfx2BOn7W5Q,5,Such a unique spot in a great neighborhood. ..Great vegan pastries; food and drink options. Very European feel to the place. A good spot to hang out drink and watch people...Fun coffee shop. Love independently owned and operated shops and business and this one is no exception to my general rule. ..Good selection of coffee and hot brews. The cappuccino was great. Very rich and well brewed. Almost felt I was back in Europe.....I also loved the customer service. Very personable and friendly. ..I think this place is a great independent coffee shop in  the area.
7fHPkHUO_tcjUUWJqP_aKw,3zFI27d75gyRrB830JX6NA,sQjTtq_JPaqQDKmI5z-Rpg,5,We took the tasting menu* with matching wines and were just blown away by the quality of the food and drink; some unique and rare wines. ($150/person) Recommended without reservation as one of the best resto's in Montreal...*Tataki de thon rouge/ wakame / champignons honey; avec Morellino di Scansaon d.o.c.; Poggio Valente Reserva 2005; Fattoria Le Pupille..Dorade royale/ poireaux aux langoustines/ ecume de mer; avec Napa Valley a.v.a.; Viognier 2000; Joseph Phelps..Foie gras de canard/ courge sunshine/ truffe d'ete; avec Hermitage a.c.; La Petite Chapelle 2004; Paul Jaboulet Aine..Cochon de lait/puree de carotte au miso/compression d'epinards avec Echezeaux Grand Cru a.c.; 2004; Domaine Jean Grivot..Plateau de fromages d'ici et d'ailleurs; avec Alsace a.c.; 2007; Domaine Marcel Deiss..La gourmandise sucree avec Jerez d.o.

7fHPkHUO_tcjUUWJqP_aKw,QmjwQ90qT5w7mbrRgVy9dA,ds3EWn_QY9xINh0uJWQpMQ,5,This place was very good; but obviously a little pricey. We started out with the foie gras de carnard. It was the most tender pieces of meat I think I've ever had in my life with a mango chutney and kind of like a toasted crust crumble. It tasted like a dessert but was absolutely amazing. For dinner I had the risotto with scallops and chorizo. The risotto was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious; rich and creamy. My boyfriend had the angus steak. He really enjoyed it; from my one bite; I thought it was okay. Maybe a little more flavor. For dessert we had chocolate mousse cake. So good. It came with a dollop of ice cream and a tiny meringue. The waiter suggested a dessert wine to pair it with and it complimented it absolutely perfectly. The service was also very good; I haven't experienced very much since arriving in Montréal.

It was a real pleasure to enjoy a wonderful meal from a  chef who boast two Michelin stars and name 'best young chef in Brussels' by Gault & Millau guide in 2013.
7fHPkHUO_tcjUUWJqP_aKw,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,0Y4TwIUsZ4BSXpwvYBtOuA,3,The Why:  Recommended by a Montreal contact when I inquired about a classy/classic French restaurant where I could take my mother and aunt without breaking the bank; La Chronique struck me as a great place to start off our dining in Montreal.  Knowing full well that my family does not have the same appreciation for haute-French as I; Chef Marc De Canck's take on provincial French seemed to strike a good balance between accessible and refined and with a convenient location on L'Avenue Laurier and a business casual lunch compared to the jackets suggested dinner destination I made a reservation for noon on a Monday...The food:..Oregano Potato Bread; Nuts and Grains Bread; Cows Milk Butter and Fleur de Sel:  Complements of the house; served piping hot; and replenished without request the nuts and grains bread was as good as many pain au cereal in Paris while the potato bread was light; aromatic; and airy...Duo de Foie Gras de Canard / pain d'epices; puree de coing; gelee d'abricots:  My obvious choice; and a wonderful one at that; this presentation of Palmex Farm's fatted duck liver was presented both seared and en terrine.  With the warm preparation served over spiced bread quince puree and the creamy chilled portion topped with a thin piece of golden bread and brown sugar crumble there was nothing particularly elaborate about this dish; just high quality ingredients paired beautifully; the sweet cutting the fat and the aromatics perfuming the palate...Filet de Proc Fume / Polenta; Courgettes; Moutarde: My plat principal; this dish was suggested as our waitress' favorite and a chef's signature with good reason.  Again quite rustic in its construction but featuring an ample cut of lean pork loin smoked and placed over toothsome polenta tinged with mustard seeds the highlight of this dish was actually the jus - a pan reduction of bacon; zucchini; and cocoa that fit somewhere between sweet and savory thus working well to meld the pork and polenta without overpowering either...Onglet de Boeuf Angus / Salsifis; Choux de Bruxelles; Champignons:  A surprising order for my mother who rarely orders beef this was another hearty dish that would have fit nicely on any French bistro menu as the tender Alberta sourced hanger steak was cooked to medium well served over a sort of confit of Brussels sprouts and salsify with lightly pickled at the side.  With mom focusing on the steak; dense and aromatic with just a touch of smoke and char I particularly appreciated the sprouts - caramelized but still pungent and a good foil to the richness of the protein...Risotto vert-pre / Epinards; Edamamaes; Courgettes:  At first I thought my aunt was truly puzzled by my translation from French; but assuring us she wanted the vegetarian offering of the afternoon I must say it turned out quite nicely with the Carnaroli rice cooked to a medium tenderness in a creamy reduction of mushrooms and peas before being garnished with chopped zucchini; shelled edemame; and shredded spinach.  Rich; vegetal; and substantial in portion the dish was anything but light but considering I rarely associate risotto with French cooking I was rather impressed...Petit Basque Sheep's Cheese with Caramelized Nuts; Apricots; Grilled Bread: Listed only as a cheese plate on the menu this one was a bit of a letdown for me.  Don't get me wrong; I love Petit Basque; especially when nicely aged as this one was - but being in Montreal I couldn't help but hope for a local cheese and while the accoutrements were nice it just wasn't what I'd anticipated at a $6 supplement...Chocolate Profiteroles with sliced almonds:  A second bummer on the dessert menu were the profiteroles ordered by my mother - two small balls of admittedly nice choux pastry encompassing rather bland vanilla ice cream but thankfully topped with dense melted chocolate.  While admittedly not a fan of profiteroles to begin with the almonds were a nice touch; but not enough to save the plate...Valrhona Molten Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream and Pineapple Mango Salsa; Caramel:  Another $6 supplemental dessert this one would actually prove to be worth the time; calories; and money. Beginning first with the cake - sticky; dense; and cooked to the perfect point to maintain the liquid center this oft duplicated dessert poured forth the dense 72% chocolate in plethora and although expectedly bitter the cocoa met an ample foil in the intense vanilla bean ice cream; sweet salsa and caramel; plus brown sugar crumble...The Verdict:  In the end I liked La Chronique well enough; the setting is lovely; the service excellent; and the prices fair for the quality (and more so the portions) given; but in comparison to the rest of our dining in  Montreal it was largely unmemorable.  A nice spot to enjoy a leisurely lunch or romantic dinner they certainly have the skills to make a classic French meal - I guess I'd just hoped for more creativity and better desserts given the cost of admission and supplements.
7fHPkHUO_tcjUUWJqP_aKw,4gBovwiJLKijLJq4-peRjg,sNEFzANd7M0P9-Hx_L_B7A,1,One of the worst experiences from a restaurant I've ever had. I made a reservation for mother's day and called two weeks in advance to make sure I had a spot. When I called; I told the host that I was a vegetarian; and asked if that would be a problem. He assured me that they had vegetarian options and it wouldn't be a problem on mother's day. For the next two weeks I was excited for my reservation. .At 3 o'clock ON mother's day; I got a call from La Chronique; and was informed that nothing on their menu was vegetarian and they were unable to prepare anything. My reservation was at 7:30; they had given me 4 and a half hours notice that they couldn't do anything for me. I told the man I was speaking with that I had been assured there was something; and he really didn't seem to care. I then had to scramble to find a new reservation..I will never be making a reservation at La Chronique and will tell everyone I know to avoid this place. I'm shocked at how disorganized and rude La Chronique was.

7fHPkHUO_tcjUUWJqP_aKw,sAB5MmC1yTCfbn28EI_I3A,Rxl5fNLKMHKWwRyICeR0tA,4,I went to La Chronique yesterday evening for dinner.  This is a nice and fairly small place to eat out.  The atmosphere and sound level was perfect for an intimate conversation and I didn't have that feeling that I sometime get where I just want to leave because of noise sound tiredness. ..We shared an appetizer (raviolis) and one party had the duck magret where the other one had the fish plate.  Presentation is phenomenal; the duck portion was quite big; where on my side; I was a bit disappointed with the fish size given the price asked for it...We finished the meal with two cheese (not the sugar type) and they were both great picks!..Service was top notch; wine recommandation for the courses was perfect and we had a great time!
7fHPkHUO_tcjUUWJqP_aKw,xJAzDoRfwgA1pXisBTXTng,SwUE1VV9l26-6pTOBlUuDw,5,Great food; excellent wine list and wonderful service. We did the tasting menu; but did our own wine choices (with the sommelier's advice) and had a fabulous; leisurely celebration.
7fHPkHUO_tcjUUWJqP_aKw,cTpR0YY_WHaEDoWwARF9tg,KhpmKCB-fpi7XWOvTuyItQ,5,Went to La Chronique while on business in Montreal due to the stellar reviews on yelp.  My only regret is not doing the wine pairing with the tasting menu. The entire meal was great; the service was fantastic; and the atmosphere was nice and quiet. Will definitely plan another visit when I'm back in Montreal.
7fHPkHUO_tcjUUWJqP_aKw,JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,5dj7Xie2hH2Dr5SGGlctVg,5,Where to have your last meal in Montreal when some of the other great places you went on the trip are closed on Tuesday?  Try something new!  And we are very glad we gave La Chronique a try.  Of course go with the tasting menu with the wine pairing because that is what we did and it was amazing!  5 courses was available the night we went.  It appears that it changes looking at the other reviews (this is a good thing!)  But we had a number of amazing and interesting dishes.  And this was still after a week of having amazing dishes.  The creativity of things in Mile End makes me so jealous!  The sweet breads with foie gras; truffled polenta and roasted mushrooms is something I will be dreaming about for a while.  ..Service was excellent.  The wine pairings worked beautifully and the waiter/somm was very excellent in explaining and talking about the wine without letting other things get away from him.  And I was very impressed when a table came in after us with three kids and he still treated them in a very professional and delightful manner.  Oh to be a kid who got to eat here!  ..Yes; it is pricy.  But treat yourself; there is a lot of skill in putting things together and the wine list is fascinating. By doing the tasting menu with the pairing you get to sample some things that you might not have had a chance to do so.
7fHPkHUO_tcjUUWJqP_aKw,uecZhhWBEQ-qe7YeEtntLg,qBvjQcRg622ZZGS9wJM73g,5,This resto recently moved across the street into a slightly larger slightly more elegant space; with a room upstairs for groups. Fortunately; the menu; staff; and wine cellar are unchanged...We had the tasting menu; seven superb little courses from amuse-bouche through mains; cheese;and dessert; with a carefully chosen glass of wine to go with each one. The staff really knows their wine; and the quality of the wine and food is quite amazing. It's very expensive; but well worth it for special occasions.
7fHPkHUO_tcjUUWJqP_aKw,_S7P6eKBi0Lm-BLXut6HcQ,bvCO4FzbAUOpgvqzQKSVUQ,5,One of the first things that strikes you about this place as you walk in is how small the dining room is. There must be; at most; fifteen tables. The atmosphere is modern; slightly stark; with bright splashes of light and curated shadows. The automatic sliding door to the kitchen; frosted with images of cutlery made me wonder if we were walking onto the set of Chopped. ..One of the slight let-downs was that although this was Taste MTL; a number of the dishes cost a little extra. The portions were somewhat small; but the intensity of flavours more than compensated. The jerusalem artichoke (topinambour) veloute was great: a bowl with toasted parmesan shavings; truffle oil and some croutons with an elegant pour-over of the soup itself. The veloute could have used a little more salt; but its understated seasoning really let the truffle; parmesan and jerusalem artichokes have center stage. The suckling pig ravioli (an extra of $12) was stunningly delicious. The ravioli were served in a deep bowl; surrounded by a rich fond-de-veau sauce infused with porcini mushrooms. The balance between this sauce; the umami kick of the slow-cooked pork in the ravioli and the slightly lemony béchamel foam on top was exquisite. The half-lobster tail on the dish; though delicious; seemed like more of an expensive garnish than a flavour that belonged in the dish...For the mains; we both got the duck breast served with beets three ways; sour cherries and a port reduction. The beets were pureed; roasted and carpaccio. The puree was the most delicious of the three; and the chef's decision to use three different colours of beets allowed for some variety. The fat on the breast was nicely carmelized with some raw sugar and the port reduction really complemented the depth of flavour in the breast; even if it was a little overcooked for my tastes (I prefer duck medium rare). The cherries had an interesting and pleasant tannic taste to them; which makes me suspect they were soaked in tea....The apricot clafoutis with dulce de leche ice cream was quite pleasant. The plating; as throughout the meal; was elegant; sophisticated and balanced. The slight tartness of the apricot nicely offset the sweetness of the dulce. The only issue I might take up with them is that the clafoutis had a non-traditional shortbread crust and was more of an apricot shortcake than the southern French dessert I was expecting. The marquise au chocolat was what you would expect: delicious; rich; velvety-dark chocolate with a nice slab of white chocolate on top...I would be leaving out one of the best parts of the meal if I didn't mention the bread. La Chronique makes their little tiny breads fresh daily (that night they had oregano; white and olive). The wine list is also worth noting; the restaurant won Best Wine Selection from Wine Spectator in 2011 and features a number of private imports among their over 250 carefully selected entries. Maybe it's just me; but the rarity and unavailability of the private imports adds to their mystique and helps justify spending way more on a bottle than at the SAQ. Wines start at $45 ...La Chronique is certainly worth the price and makes a great place for celebrating romantic special occasions. At nearly $100 a person with tax and tip; it's not cheap; but worth every penny. If you're looking to try the restaurant but don't want to spend very much; it's worth considering their lunch specials; $24 for two courses and $29 for three.

Many tables to sit at to enjoy a coffee and snack.  Bathrooms are located in the basement and the women's was not very clean. The staff was friendly and provided service with a smile. The pastries we tried were very good and the flat white was perfect.
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,0tf14Cq5NU3PBINpEDXZdQ,RpGY2g2e5kfelb04dxecEw,4,Second stop on my first night in Montreal (but First Cup. ha ha).  I didn't realize it was a chain coffee shop; until later in my trip - but nonetheless; this is a lovely place for a cup of nice espresso and fantastic selection of pastries (and cheesecake galore).  ..I figured hey.. let's go for a cappuccino; although typically I'd run for a latte.  Maybe I thought a cappuccino was more French; in my sleeplessness from the travels.  Anytime after 2pm; and it'll be decaf.  Yeah; blasphemous; but I don't like to please the insomniac in me.  I asked if the pastries are made there; and he said no.  But there were a bunch of these mini loaf cakes in a jar up front.  They looked perfect and cozy.  Almond shortcake...  sold.  ..Let me tell you; it was one of the best desserts I've had.  Barely sweet; very buttery; and moist as can be.  My kind of dessert.  I almost went back on my final day to pick up a bag of just these.  ..Prices are reasonable; and probably $6-7 (I forget exactly).  Great seating up front to catch the view of passers by; heading to and away from Crescent St...Although it's a chain; I think it's limited to Canada.  Not sure.  If you want a decaf that doesn't taste decaf; and a nice selection of something sweet that isn't necessarily homemade but still quite yummy; give it a try.
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,ze0maaIfxxYGnoKvtF_YTQ,-9p0E5WvTuof96jBfAj_3A,5,The atmosphere is amazing you can relax grab a nice coffee and a tasty sandwich with dessert. Def beats Starbucks and Tim Horton's!  Oh and of course the FAST and complimentary WiFi is always reliable.
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,xRBnIhqYTJZcEA4-wuZ4uA,CgrccFCdjUqhRFJMm5bAsA,4,Ok; I mean...its a chain. Kind of like Starbucks. I've had tea and iced tea here and wasn't disappointed by the product or service. ..Not really much else to say I guess.
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,yBbhNiEwzSf8T8xWvfTLhA,8_gxFsLZniujiTirHpdTUw,3,Should be 3.5 stars. ..I'm somewhat surprised with the reviews saying it is a best place in town and giving it 3 stars.....Anyway; stopped there for breakfast - I guess it was a mistake; as while I was expecting all the sandwiches to be made on the spot; they were pre-made and only heated up. English muffin was very soggy after that heating up....Coffee was ok; but not great - I have higher expectations for coffee in French Canada..I guess it is a good place if you need WiFi and place to work; but I can't recommend it as a food place.
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,lvOyh8H-oAltauebsvlt4w,EMNHuxeg4S3gLehbsdVfEQ,4,great place confortable and relax; but the music is too LOUUUUDDDD

Cheesecakes with strawberry or blueberries look great. A bit loudly environment thou especially on weekend days. Btw; staff is so friendly which is a big plus to me.

9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,vX7hibM5opbV_8w10Q18Ag,-0ffozxYoQqvREeCOrtOCA,5,The frozen hot chocolate here is awesome awesome awesome.  Something about the Canadian whipped cream....it's just delicious.  They have a ton of seating and free wifi so it's a perfect place to relax after a long day of tourist walking.  I forgot the name of the drink since it's in French but it did have the word chocolate in it and it was on the right hand side of the menu.  ..This is my first review out of the NYC five boroughs so you know it has to be good!
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,Y3FaK8vkd1RyYFExHmfLJQ,4,This place means business; strong smell of roasted coffee in the air; people eating late night snacks; a great selection of anything java or non java to tempt your senses!
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,B5mpfVCviyUl9Bsdef5jUQ,S2unSX5fgpu1vGpwWNCORw,4,Great central location (right next to Reuben's); open 24 hours; free Wifi; huge seating area...what else could you ask for in a coffee shop?..Well; good coffee I suppose.  The bold tastes like old coffee to me.  I am not coffee aristocrat; so don't jump down my throat.  I suggest the flavor of the day for you I only want to look cool while getting caffeine drinkers.
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,3fLXys0GUqZjF8ChzGliSQ,ruW6MLlI-Cmn5ZwYxgemgg,5,We really enjoyed the coffee and food here..She really enjoyed the decaf; I enjoyed the regular. .We also enjoyed the falafel wrap they had..We had breakfast there four days in a row (took sandwiches from other locations in as well).

9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,yD5npU0MGi1Q94HHTjHcBQ,YWbCJu5bkYruvzbdZ5Na_A,5,Got a cup of Flat White..Quality of the coffee products in second cup is always good. Coffee is warm and fresh; also everything in this store is Canadian; proudly Canadian .Comparing to Starbucks; this location is much cleaner. And the coffee shop environment is much better than other coffee chains.
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,kkPmwboW5Fe5a0ZrqTvCHg,C4Sm5IdNsGUhxzh4cagQtw,4,The first place I came to after a long flight to Montreal. Has good wifi; very spacious; a bathroom (cleanliness questionable); and great place to work or chat or charge up. I sat by the window and watched people walking around downtown :)
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,CwUvSaeItqpFCDh0jHaNuQ,j1fuxHh9r9whXyF7FQy2BA,4,Food: Love Flat White~ and thankfully the ones at Second Cup never failed~ Also at this new location in Sainte-Catherine; much more varieties of pastries and other food options~..Service: Had to remind the barista that she forgot our second Flat White; apologized++ and made it right away; did not compromise speed over quality however :) the service very quick also despite it was very busy..Price: avg for coffee..Ambiance: I love this new location; high ceiling; well illuminated; high bench and regular seats; busy but not nosy~
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,CRDzo_B8b-jztUa8yDqcXA,aIU1RT8IFB26tQH1TZe0MA,4,Needed a lil pick-me-up at the end of our day and the Gingerbread latte was sooo good; too bad the guy behind the counter only made one drink for the two of us...I guess something got lost in translation. But other then that it was very yummy and pretty to look at
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,E22V6wlHhVYFdQ_TeY_DKQ,R2jMk5xvCsu9_w679heZsw,3,Got the caramel latte. A bit on the pricey side but very good cup. Servers are polite.
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,4fs5twXLtjf4uvEv068pQw,4,They finally opened the top floor! It's beautiful; spacious; and perfect to sit and get a bit of work/reading done. Before they had the upstairs area; it sucked to come here because it wasn't comfortable. I would just get my drink to go. Now it's great! ..I like this location; it has lots of food options and the wait is never long..The staff has never messed up my order (I do order the same thing every time though) and they always smile when I visit...Only downside is that if you stay too long you start smelling like coffee!
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,i6w1V5iPWdYKVPnZLOeLkA,ykDhEb7ja5MM0G2HQqVQng,4,I loved Second Cup!  When I leave the US I vow to stay away from Starbucks and Second Cup made this not only possible; but quite enjoyable!  Prices are high (but everything is higher in Canada!); but the coffee is rich and the carrot cake here is fluffy and rich but not too sweet or heavy!  .Also; I can't forget to mention the free wifi access if you are a tourist that does't want to rack up roaming charges :)
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,HqjMKuBah0isAJ4CBB73aA,oeblpD7YiYiMAVP2WvrWNg,1,had a cup of regular coffee. It was so bad; I had to throw it out. I should have returned it. I think it's due to the new barista; must be her first day; she did not seem like she knows how to brew a cup of coffee at all.
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,Ctrp5IoEKHkixDSIyYHDpw,WfVRZkvQg60zI5ljvvmrQw,3,Being on St. Catherine; this location is always going to be packed and noisy. They have a decent selection of sandwiches if you need more than java; but the bacon; egg and cheese muffin tasted like something you'd get out of the freezer section and microwave at home. Not exactly worth $3.75 plus tax.
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,941m7FFFBeoCRLXJZxflzw,TASBnVI68iCNWLOUOBjW1w,4,I came here with my mother for breakfast and food was great! I got the frozen hot chocolate with an apple baba and she got the vanilla bean latte with cheddar croissant. The atmosphere was nice and clean in the middle of everything so were finished eating when the shops were opening up. Drinks were good and the food was ok; nothing too special. Service was quick. Would recommend!
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,9TT_mBR1xKn5I62vg1yu7w,3KksmvPasgWYd_3sacE2pQ,4,Second Cup really makes me want to go back for seconds. I am wary of chain coffee shops; namely Starbucks. Nevertheless; Second Cup is the exception. It is laid out similarly to Starbucks but it is much more creative and has more variety of food and beverages. ..I had their mochachino with skim milk and it is made with dark chocolate and espresso. It is so rich I cannot even tell it is actually skim milk. My husband also got a cup of chocolate with mint latte and it is as good as it gets. ..People are hanging out in the cafe and they have a wide selection of sandwiches; cakes; and desserts. I wish I had a chance to return!
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,Z9EO5CL6sOA1Ct9SlHWU_g,mbcb_u7anH7ONtNImnz3ow,3,Very nice and comfy place to hangout with friends while drinking coffee. They are open late if not 24 hrs. It's one of the best places in the downtown area to work/hangout late nights.
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,R2IomLf8WgtjEmAzZhYa-A,yzHzBhOy7j4vZQTSKOz86Q,3,Malheureusement seulement 3 étoiles pour un Second Cup .... L'endroit est est très beau; on a vraiment envie d'y travailler. En plus; C'EST GRAND alors ce serait surprenant qu'il n'y ait plus de place nulle part pour s'asseoir...Le gros point négatif: Le Wifi !! Si tu réussis à te connecter; tu vas constater que c'est vraiment lent. Sinon; tu seras juste tout simplement jamais capable de te connecter! ..C'est vraiment dommage parce que pour le reste c'est très bien !! (À la hauteur des autres Second Cup que j'ai visité; et même plus)..Si tu veux juste jaser autour d'un café ou d'un peu de bouffe; go for it though !!
9B9VEYYj8oW5byOZeerwaQ,ujOwZo999jM6bhkSXOX61w,ShyNWhR7It9Bf1rLEiMaaA,4,Conveniently located..Recently renovated..Very fast service; someone takes your order while you are still in line so when you get @ cashier your drink is ready!!..Love their matcha tea latte!.Wifi is free but sometimes bugs..
9L8UgjIvLfwylrFacB2HuA,50CacOqb-69QlndXYWkwNg,6lu7DGTstJ0kDdZDDx-ZHQ,4,Great for brinch. They sell also high quality truffle pesto
9L8UgjIvLfwylrFacB2HuA,NaW6r6e2dwXSv5qLrL7ZkQ,H0antjS5a1H92Sd9nua7WQ,4,Okay; I was a bit surprised at how good this place was. Maybe because most department store cafes are usually mediocre; but I've been here twice and have left happy both times. ..They specialize in open faced sandwiches; have a pretty decent wine and cocktail list and serve Illy coffee...The lamb tartine is well made; served with hummus. I love their beet salad; a perfect refresher. ..However; my favourite would be the brunch tartine; basically like eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. Delish!..Service was spot on and the tab; well a bit pricey but worth it.
9L8UgjIvLfwylrFacB2HuA,2ZfhOYE8NKSxv8bXG5lDnQ,pOc82mPeTBeiL3HIvs71IQ,4,A lovely place to stop by and enjoy your coffee or meal. So special service by workers. Deserts were good. Coffee is soft. Very good atmosphere.

9L8UgjIvLfwylrFacB2HuA,KFJ938JLMqyE5JTI7D5tNw,xYiHI8Xc8aC91PePcpQJcQ,4,This cafe is located on the lower floor of Holt Renfrew; and the decor is modern. Service is friendly and fast. .My fav is the Chicken Tartine or the Caprese Tartine; which are both open faced sandwiches using Poilane bread.  I could literally eat them every day; and do each time I visit the area. .If you enjoy carrot cake; you must try theirs!
9L8UgjIvLfwylrFacB2HuA,hMY0wsj3VxOaBixV_6YnuA,xlOeZ00ceHPl1cyNxuT2Iw,4,Cafe Holt is situated on the lower level of Holt Renfrew.  Came here for a late/light lunch with a friend.  The space is very white and modern looking with a small bar...As it was my first meal of the day I was hungry and got a starter and a main dish.  As a starter I chose the lobster and crab ravioli.  Portion size was great (about 5 raviolis) and it was very tasty.  My main dish was the taleggio grilled cheese.  It was good; but I found it to be a little too small for the price; since nothing was accompanying it as well (unless you count sprigs of alfalfa sprouts an accompaniment).  It is a tad expensive; but its of good quality and offers a variety of choices to suit all kinds of tastes...They also have a decent wine selection...The service was acceptable and efficient.  (I have sat at both the bar and a table before)...In all; Cafe Holt offers a nice refreshing fresh tasting lunch when its getting harder to come by in the downtown area.
9L8UgjIvLfwylrFacB2HuA,PVOtG_2eJOnJLoLmT_rQig,i-cGcgwn7CJLz0G32yAHwA,3,The food is pretty decent; and so is the service. Very small portions. The items were a bit off key; some were not balanced with flavors (either too bland; or too overpowering). I'd have to think before I go here again; though the ambience and decor are nice.
9L8UgjIvLfwylrFacB2HuA,ODLqGojIJZ-M3Mpieag29g,BQ0RUbp5yuV3HCO6mmLDKg,1,Brought a friend for lunch on Sunday.  We went after the lunch rush was over so there were plenty of tables and several staff.  The wait was very long and when we were finally served we got a piece of burnt toast - charred black and so hard it couldn't be cut with a knife; and spread with a paper-thin layer of cooked mushroom topping.  It was inedible and got sent back.  The salad I ordered instead took forever to arrive and by that time I had lost my appetite and with it the pleasure of dining out with a friend.  The salad was small and average and the whopping bill of $47 confirmed my intention to give this place a pass next time I am in the area.
9L8UgjIvLfwylrFacB2HuA,nptaypYVM2RVTgm0uuCzeA,5fAHPuUUvS1stKpF_7QKDg,5,The service was fantastic; the food delicious and surprisingly affordable. Although this isn't the place  for avant garde or québécois cuisine it's perfect for a quick bite while walking downtown or in the area. Thanks for the great experience!
9L8UgjIvLfwylrFacB2HuA,wgUsDf8DSfdpR75EPZwZ4Q,cLzMsITuOZm7qfS5TSxmeQ,4,The beef tartine is delicious. The parm fries are also the best fries in Montréal. Now they have more options in the menu and we love it! Everything is made with fresh ingredients and you can tell; and the portions are perfect.
_9uNm7NNMgiJyzEwLY9ccg,tWBLn4k1M7PLBtAtwAg73g,7ud-ptkw-0cHOZFMU0S63w,3,It's nearing 4am and I'm drunk and hungry. Well imagine my delight when the lights to this quaint little pizza shop were glowing when returning to our hotel next door..We crushed a few slices of various types of pizza. There was nothing really remarkable about the pizza; but it was reasonably tasty for a reasonable price. .A solid 3 star slice; and even at this ridiculous hour it was actually the namesake of the store; Dany; working the til. A kudos to that kind of commitment to serving the za..This place is indeed; A-OK.
_9uNm7NNMgiJyzEwLY9ccg,Edhsd2A56QLABhmrIWEprQ,XZX_yu_9QCOA01QJ9sOxEw,4,Look; you don't come here for frills. It's basic pizza by the slice. But it's also cheap; big; and tastes surprisingly good - there's no grease dripping off your hands or questionable toppings. And a few days a week; they'll even scoop a handful of fries on top in case you need that extra calorie boost. ..Cheap; good pizza. What's not to like?
9XMdULm5NCZcq3pO1Loejw,VcveOBK2hOb2-gpZHjwtww,_s5lkrdop0Z0ZDhmJN_kFw,3,My boyfriend brought my family and I to this restaurant. I like the idea that the chef cooks in front of you and our chef was hilarious; which made the environment more welcoming. However; the food was still too simple for me. The shrimp was marinated pretty well and they give large amounts so many of you will surely feel full.
9XMdULm5NCZcq3pO1Loejw,EMpjcN4Jf8ehkWUAwinnYA,LGsF97MHAgWn_yOW2XaADg,5,J'ai adoré mon expérience chez Kobé. Nous y sommes allés pour le 60e de ma mère et c'est un endroit parfait pour un anniversaire. La nourriture est excellente; tant le porc; les crevettes; mais surtout le filet mignon! Les chefs sont plein d'humour et savent faire un show impressionnant. Pour les fêtés; 3 serveurs viennent à votre table et chantent Bonne Fête accompagnés d'un gong. Bref; du plaisir pour les yeux et les papilles!
9XMdULm5NCZcq3pO1Loejw,sck44wZW844jqTzKhQOHug,8K4uES-rEVWpKEawzn2KOw,3,It was good very funny the cook would have been better to serve all the food together and not part by part ! Meaning he cooks the shrimps and gives it cooks chicken gives it cooks rice and gives it ! Man im hungry i wanna eat loool
9XMdULm5NCZcq3pO1Loejw,QYC3HlU2lVeocJSU_UP73A,3FylnPlaECSuWba8QxmJTA,4,I am giving 4 stars because after reading the comments; I thought I would be disappointed. We actually got Groupon for it so that's why we went. The portion were extremely generous and the meat was fresh. The cook was funny and entertaining; we actually enjoyed the experience. I wouldn't necessarily go back but I didn't feel like I wasted my time and/or money.
9XMdULm5NCZcq3pO1Loejw,iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,GAV-04nGYkHABKzqtDm9pw,4,As a treat for my sister's 40th birthday; I wanted something special and that we never tried...I read some of the bad reviews here (and on tripadvisor); but still chose here because they have free parking and a Sunday to Thursday menu which is about $10 less per person. (it helps a lot when paying for 5 people). I would have preferred Toyo downtown; but it would have cost way too much...We arrived a bit too early when they opened and were the only ones there; the service took a while to get going. Once we got apps and drinks; things improved..The tempura and chicken wings were delicious; the spring rolls were good; but only 2 small rolls for $5...Once we finished; we met our cook who was very polite and cordial but not as flashy as some of the cooks I saw on youtube...Yes it's cheesy and tacky and it feels like the 70's inside. Real Japanese people probably don't eat like this; but we had fun; which is what matters. The food was pretty tasty and we were all full when we left. ..You get soup; salad; the Teppanyaki of your choice with tea and dessert; and a nice little show for about $20...They also gave us a couple of bamboo calendars. The service is pretty good; but they wait for a table to be full before sending a chef; so you might be dining with strangers..but it's the same at other Japanese steakhouses...This place is a bit out of the way; but there is free parking and it's about a block from the Metro Langelier Subway Station.
ABtMH47_GMTr5lysPib96g,ZwLfrWgTq7uFBQMEjr5ugA,cy2ZD0b6bJKmbSuExnPN_A,3,Yes; one can't expect culinary bliss inside the Montreal airport.  We were stuck between flights; unaware at that point that our four-hour layover would end up lasting sixteen thanks to Air Canada's rubber band breaking on their flying yak.  Before realizing this fact; we took a break at Cabine M; and credit given for having a unique name.  Not sure what the M stands for; Montreal or Marcotte (found on their menu).  The décor was simple enough; and I liked the dividing wall offering some measure of privacy.  However; I doubt the wall of wine on the near wall has ever been opened...Beyond their simple menu; they also offer a chef's tasting page designed (apparently) by something called HMSHost; which I discovered later was some gigantic conglomerate responsible for menus and meals for other restaurants specialized in catering to travelers.  Why travelers needed their own specialized menu; I'll never know.  Apparently Cabine M (Marvel?) couldn't be bothered to design one on their own...I guess?  Odd that they'd call it a Chef's Tasting since obviously the chef on tap at Cabine M (Mancy?) had no hand in the creation of this menu.  Odd coincidence; HMSHost is owned by Autogrill; something I would get to know very well on my upcoming trip to Italy (the same one delayed).  ..So yeah; we ordered the tasting menu.  For $26; it promised (apparently) four starter courses and your choice of one protein among three.  Sounds like a steal.  Here is where things get a little muddy: a tasting menu involves several plates over a long period.  What Cabine M (Math?) did was throw all five selections on a single plate and serve it all at once.  I ordered the rosemary grilled chicken breast.  The tasting starters promised a reversed nacho; roasted asparagus; Caesar salad; and a chef's potato.  Let's call this out for what it was--a full page advertising a single plate of food.  Talk about pretentious.  The chicken breast was resting on the asparagus and potatoes; next to the salad with four tortillas resting in a small cup of salsa.  ..No; you're right; squirting tube-fed salad dressing over uncut Romaine with three croutons on top equates avante garde.  Why the hell; did this plate require a page of detail?  It's one plate of food.  It wasn't bad; but holy crap; was that a lot of hype for what amounted to very little food.  I counted five potatoes the size of D&D dodecahedrons.  Three; count'em; three tortillas.  Three croutons over uncut Romaine.  Even the chicken wasn't very big; and this restaurant needed to outsource this page to a giant multi-national conglomerate?..I don't think I have properly explained how exaggerated this plate was.  This entire offering required 55 words on its own isolated laminated page.  The nachos; asparagus; potatoes; and salad were each given their own paragraph with header and description.  Each possible alternate protein had its own suggested wine offering.  Not even posh bistros in downtown London have the gall to put this much effort into a single plate of food.  If it was stellar; an iconic upper echelon of gastronomic bliss; I could see about giving them a pass; but at the end of the day; it was simply okay.  I can't stand it when restaurants go the artsy fartsy approach to salad--uncut lettuce with squirted dressing; forcing me to make a mess with knife and fork in order to enjoy a simple salad.  Sorry; Cabine M (Mediocre...); get a real tasting menu designed by your local chef and try again; and use less words this time.    ..Food:  2.5/5.Service:  3/5.Presentation:  2.5/5.Value:  3/5.Recommendation:  2.75/5
B09fjWeac4RCygHPFryYvw,h_pWuc_XfoR2Ht29L5hlIQ,liUrw64_BJ0YGFkq8prfxw,5,Outstanding ice cream with that amazing maple butter swirl! This place is just fabulous. Don't be discouraged by the line. It's a popular place and the proprietor is delightful!
B09fjWeac4RCygHPFryYvw,Zv_rMzv_8-c2-g0WtEXlTg,16_JxOgajR_erTe7ED3_dw,4,Imagine the regular vanilla ice cream. Now... Imagine it with maple! Not too much... Just enough to make it awesome! ..But I'm not satisfied and... I chose to dip it on chocolat noir! ..Just as delicious as you are thinking. But they have also other options. Of course! ..They recently open this year at the Marché Atwater and for me they already deserve to be considered as a choice of dessert after having lunch at the market.
BCzug9UfSB0jlU6Xa8txpg,HyGuZIfb_jwjXzMCerAJ4g,VrujLSxLmvbS-gdXQIgU6w,3,OOH; a coffee place besides Starbucks and Tim Horton's. Rare. Second Cup has pretty good coffee--for some reason; every Starbucks I've been to in Montreal can't get coffee or tea right. I don't know how anyone can screw up tea; but they did. So thankfully; there's Second Cup...The only weird thing about Second Cup is that their bathrooms are behind some locked gate you can only get to with a key attached to a plastic LADLE. So odd.
BCzug9UfSB0jlU6Xa8txpg,augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,NnRNXCWpIbkHkU5LO9mQLQ,2,I dropped in for a coffee today at Second Cup.  I prefer the medium roast (Paradiso) coffee here to the other coffee places coffee.  Yes I know; how boring?!?!  However I just wanted a good cup of coffee...Wow is the staff here packed compared to some of the other places!  They had about 4-5 people at the counter taking order after order for the lineup they had.  They were really fast and greeted me in french and english.  They were really nice; really fast to get my coffee and had me in and out of there in less than a minute. ..Well run show Second Cup on Sainte-Catherine Rue!

BHTWG6p3FsnnlCGMotvuAQ,A9RKvWz-as6hzSKS_xwVrw,5KmAg-3BIKYcD73mIUR7gg,5,yum!  my parents and i enjoyed some delicious homemade italian fare at pasta casareccia's.  half is a lunch eatery that has a 50's meets 80's kitch interior and half displays all the goodies that you can take home with you.  the specials are listed on a chalkboard near a shiny red vespa that is up for a drawing - all you put is your name and number on the back of your bill to enter...the spaghetti with meat sauce (i asked for a little bit spicy) was fantastic!  there is nothing like fresh pasta.  the meat ravioli au gratin was also very good.  we finished the meal with the homemade tiramisu which was light; fluffy and creamy with our coffees...afterwards; we couldn't pass up the chance to buy and take home some meat lasagna and more spaghetti with spicy meat sauce.  after 2 lunches in a row of pasta from this joint - i'm still humming italian tunes.  the lasagna by the way is the best i have ever tasted!
BHTWG6p3FsnnlCGMotvuAQ,qKpkRCPk4ycbllTfFcRbNw,9YaO0Ym2kVD2Dsxh8bngxw,4,J'aime bien le local un peu oldy bien entretenu; quoique petit; produits italiens pour apporter ainsi qu'un table avertie et limité pour les commensales. Service un peu rude en restant professionnel !
BHTWG6p3FsnnlCGMotvuAQ,iXWPU9J4A7JU3TYKW0RwdA,xVVSRE1B3ZqOlWF-itunvQ,5,Excellent special of the day:  house made Agnolotti filled with Squash in a sage; butter; Parmesan sauce!  Whole wheat penne;  house made; with primavera sauce !  Finished our meal with a homemade tiramisu!  Excellent Service; too!..I try to go to fresh pasta restaurants; and this place is fresh and fantastic!
BHTWG6p3FsnnlCGMotvuAQ,R-WeeJj8sL2o-6kiT4OblA,I5dCGpBpoSGOs1clehI_zg,5,I brought my date whom is Italian to this restaurant and it did not disappoint. The waiter was patient and attentive. For starters we got the Arugula mozzarella with ham and it was amazing. The mozzarella is melt in your mouth. I had the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and it was probably the best pasta I have ever tasted. My date chose the cannelloni with cheese and tomato sauce. Everything was delicious. We had cannoli for desert and it was excellent. We liked the deli small restaurant vibe and the ambiance. I will be sure to pass by again!
BHTWG6p3FsnnlCGMotvuAQ,U2OPJc9c1q7VToeKeTZ-UA,1YFAyVtq5awgGFjS2-ryPg,4,This restaurant is on a street corner of Sherbrooke but doesn't visually stand out - however it is an interesting place to eat at or to shop in.  There is seating in front and a larger room in back that can host private events. There is also a small section where you can buy Italian grocery items that you won't see at your local grocery store. The service is excellent - friendly and knowledgeable.  I enjoyed the food - I went with classics (caesar salad and fettuccine Alfredo) and wasn't disappointed - friends had some of the specials and deconstructed salad - too many options to list - everyone left full and happy.
BHTWG6p3FsnnlCGMotvuAQ,ZWw6YfVryUf62OwRFslTUw,lz69RRgZSaKeRXzqAvVURw,2,Not great service; or prices.  I've eaten there before and was happy with the no frills; decent pasta... But prices have definitely gone up.  We ordered a lunch special to split between a 3yr old and a 5yr old - we were informed that lunch specials can't be split; and we'd have to pay full price.  That wouldn't bother me for adults; but for two kids who are going eat a fraction of the meal; it's just not cool.  With no reasonable options for the kids; we left.  Maybe they're OK with that; but there was only one other table; so I have to wonder...
BHTWG6p3FsnnlCGMotvuAQ,09WhZPo9JAp1gu4-HVVdWA,gZbGs5r4rAHdfG8wtjVlpA,5,Great pasta!  We first had the meatballs and rice balls as appetizers and everything was very good.  Then we had fresh pasta with pesto; pesto rosso; bolognese and arrabiatta sauces. Everything was delicious.  You could really tell the pasta was fresh.   I love when you can choose the pasta shape and the sauce separately so each combination is possible.  Some pasta shapes were also available in whole wheat versions.   The portions were not too big so you have a good meal but do not feel stuffed at the end.  I highly recommend this place!
BHTWG6p3FsnnlCGMotvuAQ,WjVFL3II4-N32yHZNCH-5g,nezciL015sIxjLv58-dIeg,2,I really liked this place like 10 years ago: the portions were just right; so was the price ($8.95 for 4 cheese cannelloni with your choice of sauce; unlimited bread; etc).  Service was excellent and attentive and the place was full!..I recently returned and the prices jumped so dramatically: same cannelloni above is now in the $13 range!  I was embarrassed: my guest and I had our meals come close to $50 with a tepid warm coffee and a shared piece of cake.  We were only among one other couple on a Friday night...To top it off; the arabiatta sauce was not at all spicy like it used to be; and the cannelloni were not stuffed with cheese; only filled *ever so slightly* to say it was not just plain pasta and sauce...To the management of Pasta Casareccia: Return to the previous price point (or just slightly above considering inflation is like 3%); portion sizes (including filling the cheese cannelloni) and you will have a return customer; and a filled restaurant...I am not sure how this restaurant stays in business: it is never full; regardless of the day and time I have passed by!
BHTWG6p3FsnnlCGMotvuAQ,bds7VxgVm0e6Pu5RuVV-wg,loqF3R55bMYJH8w0c638yg,3,I wanted to come here on a Sunday since it's my only day off. Unfortunately I didn't find out until later that day that they are actually closed on Sundays . So I went the next day; I was really craving pasta and I've heard good things about this place. ..The employees were very welcoming and nice. Our seats were facing the window and the street of Sherbrooke. They have a little boutique inside that sells Italian goods. ..For starters; we ordered suppli do riso(risotto balls with mozzarella and tomato sauce $8). These were delicious; the mozzarella was perfectly melted and the tomato sauce completed the dish. For our main dishes; my boyfriend ordered the spek(ham) and porcini fettucine ($22) and I ordered the gnocchi with the Norcina sauce (black truffle; sausage; white wine; cream $23). I tried both hehe. I thought the spek and porcini sauce was alright; nothing special. I liked my dish better; the Norcina sauce was very mouthwatering and delightful! Both dishes were very heavy and we were not able to finish them. The waiter nicely packed them for us. For dessert; we had the tiramisu which cost $7. The tiramisu was decent; not too sweet. Overall our bill came up to $80 with the tip and the taxes. ..To conclude; price-wise I think it's a little overpriced. The food is good but I wasn't amazed. The service on the other hand was on point; our waiter was very attentive and fast. Would I go back ? Maybe if I was around the area.
BHTWG6p3FsnnlCGMotvuAQ,YRpSeeHw2znjWst7LBPrHA,i6wNSX921T3nDf6nj-IX2g,2,My family have been ordering large lasagnas from this place for 20+ years . Somehow 9 of us ended up here . So old; so tired ! We were warmly greeted by the server who was likely the manager . He was the high point ..The rice balls ( arancini ) were oily and stale . My fish in paper was beyond awful . Tiny overcooked portion . The chicken puttanesca was OK but quite dry . Very likely reheated . Other dishes were also poor . .No salt and pepper on the tables; no glasses of water but strangely lots of fruit flies . Frankly the food deserved a 1 star but the service and the memory of their lasagna  earned it an extra star .
BiNwyvye8hP_dgxggYZd1Q,YheJrg5LWIVQpIUfGle-GQ,QGoZSZw36LHsc4H1YLR93w,3,J'y suis allée en fin de semaine avec quelques bloggueurs.  Très bien situé; près de transport en commun; j'ai été surprise à quel point que le restaurant était vide à notre arrivée.  C'est dommage.  L'accueil était extrêmement chaleureux.  Le menu offre beaucoup mais vraiment beaucoup d'items frits.  Je ne dénigre pas du tout ce fait; ils maîtrisent très bien la notion de friture. Mais mettons qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup de légumes ou de fraîcheur dans les assiettes.  Je recommande l'aloo pie qui est un entrée à base de patates et d'épices qui donne un petit kick envelopé d'une pâte qui est frite.  La spécialité est le rôti qui est une fine pâte dans laquelle on enveloppe encore une fois des patates avec une protéine; soit du boeuf; du poulet; des crevettes et... de la viande de chèvre!  Et vous pouvez choisir de l'avoir épicée ou avec la sauce de côté! Une chose est sûre; ils ne lésinent pas sur la quantité; vous en ressortirez très pleins en ayant dépenser peu.  Mais je vous avertis; c'est très lourd...
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,ey2K30UtsK2oBT-gr_kufw,rLqHk8BKsyect-2MFiRR8Q,4,The food was great; but the line was long to get seated; even at 8:30PM on a Saturday...The ordering system was a bit weird. When we gave our second order; they brought us the wrong order; and then ignored us when we told them so. ..It appeared as if around 10PM; the servers stopped working. They deliberately ignored us (perhaps to make people finish faster). At this point; we were trying to check out; but the line to check out (no; they don't bring you the bill) was about 6 families long. Each paid with credit card; but it seemed like we waited for 30 minutes before we got to pay. The line was reminiscent of what we went through at customs!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,PPlnagaOUdXjgh_FwAaVIA,oCL4u7QjEg9E29-ZKPFQyA,4,It is an interesting experience for someone that is not used to this kind of food. I liked the choice of broth (spicy or mild); the taste of the broth; the all you can eat seafood and fresh veggies. They have a great selection of fresh veggies and seafood you can put in the broth. It is really healthy and tasty. I like the fact that putting food in the broth slow down the eating pace of everyone around the table; so that the meal last longer; giving us more time to talk and enjoy each other company. I am planning on going back when i'm in Montreal! The place is huge; so it is good for groups; family; etc...
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,65qbB9h_uLvS5JTiC-g-0A,L7EdgrK531hXM97NVnNXow,4,had some mongolian hot pot on a summer night; not sure if that was smart but we were all craving some. the selection is pretty good; and standard. they put it all in the fridge and you basically go and grab whatever. the quail eggs were tasty; so were the turnips. we were in the separate chamber since we had a large group and i preferred that anyway because its more private and the noise level can be controlled. the meats arrived promptly by the waiters and the service was decent. a good hot pot place to try.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,hfzIucnKdAXemPUL3wfNxg,ktEzj7HtEIeJV8d7eR8FDA,5,Great place; very authentic and reasonable price. Lots of fun.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,_AKf0jab-DI0xGQDiWjf-g,a_gM7u_MqXbT2QVi54uY1A,5,Nice experience. The food was fresh. We took the spicy hot pot. We really enjoyed the lamb meat and the shrimp balls. They also have braised beef chops which are delicious. Overall great food; great service and the prices are reasonable.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,V6MsTK2hkVOMqilpcZpb1A,6HWm6FrbiDQZ4dQchyQVUQ,3,Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of hot pot. There is nothing more satisfying than throwing ingredients into a flavourful boiling hot broth and watch it cook as you anticipate what it will taste like in your mouth. The concept of AYCE makes it even more exciting for me. However; Montreal's Little Sheep is a let down for this promising idea. .I am not a very picky eater but I do expect food to be fresh and make me feel safe about eating it. The meats were fresh enough; but on the other hand; the veggies weren't all washed. I suspected dirt on them. Make sure to have the pot boiling before putting anything in; do not eat raw food. .The seasoning bar was ridiculous... Sesame sauce was diluted with lots of water; I had to add 2 teaspoon of salt and soya sauce to make it taste something. No ingredient was labelled; it was such a struggle to mix the dipping sauce. Someone give me advice on how to differentiate salt/sugar; vinegar/soya sauce without looking weird and tasting them :(. .Anyways; the make-your-own-food experience is something to try out; and if you're YOLO enough; do give it a try. Taste wise it's not that bad because the broth is still good and tasty. .Price is high for what you get as of quality of food. .I'd say service is better than average Chinatown restaurants; orders came quickly at our tables.  .I will not be back before a long time; I would rather try other hotpot locations in Montreal.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,BSVThVjjFaF5orzkW7Of7Q,JJNOg6GNu9yNTE0pViM7SQ,3,Little Sheep is your typical; average hot pot spot. And that makes sense; since Little Sheep is just one of many franchises scattered across the world. ..They have a decent selection of ingredients (beef; chicken; squid; shrimp; veggies; etc.). The service is average. ..There's usually a wait at lunchtime or dinnertime.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,q01khtt3I3bWBvHGxwA6vA,203nlvl5WGLtNzORyb19Og,4,4 stars food.0 stars service; it was totally abysmal this time.  what up with that?  the girl at the front was a total you know what.  anyway...its a good thing the whole food experience saved the day.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,_zNNZnzAZYx2u1xZLxWnjA,9unWTop1ESPfTK2WeW_ZvA,5,When I reviewed this place online and from other reviews; I thought this was a typical Mongolian restaurant.  You know; raw meat; veggies; and noodles that you choose to your liking and a sauce to compliment for a taste truly your own; bring to a giant wok and have someone braving 7 foot flames to stir fry it all for you...It was....kinda/sorta...You DO pick out your raw faves; but the selection was so much more vast.  Veggies included Taro; Kale; Pumpkin; Bok Chou and meats included lamb; beef; chicken; the hugest prawn I've ever seen. For a walk on the wild side; meats included chicken hearts and liver even tripe.  And for the starch-loving gal like me; why ; 7 different types of noodles was akin to a choir of angles singing...Instead of bringing it to the firefighting wok master; you instead bring all of the rarities to your table where a hot pot of broth is boiling happily on your own personal burner.  You can choose from regular; hot; or super spicy broth.  I'm a chicken; so it was an order of regular for me and my brave husband chose hot.  They bring the order yin/yang where you have a pot divided in two with your respective broth choices.  ..Then; you drop in your fixings and wait for the bubbling action to cook your dinner; strain it; and garnish it with whichever dipping sauce you deem fit...Essentially; it's fondue with an Asian twist.  And I'd never want Mongolian any other way...If you're in Old Towne Montreal; this is a MUST.  It's close to the Metro and easy to recognize with the fuzzy sheep sign logo in green. (Most signs were red or yellow; so it stood out)..The restaurant was very clean; staff extremely polite and helpful; and the food was perfect.  I'm sending a snow of emails to get this chain (voted to 100 chains in China as well as one of the top 500 restaurants in a country that surely must have over a billion chains) in my neck of the woods...Best. Experience. Ever.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,60v7H_m0Atd_98oCwqclew,BbSDya41a5spVwQ98uekQw,3,Although this place was on the list for Montreal's 10 worst health code violators... there is just something about the soup that keeps me coming back. I know the restaurant is probably filthy; but I just can't stay away. My hope is that the hot soup kills all the bacteria and we will leave satisfied and full with no problems except the nasty smell it leaves behind in your clothes; skin and hair.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,ONumHqZf1aVnVK7biD-FCg,yOD1qv8Gpi2OoURIHtlhFg,5,Great place! Very spacious; not a feeling of crowdiness even if the place was full by the time we left...When we arrived; we were greeted and offered either two places with our own heater; or a shared heater with a big pot half normal; half spicy...The ingredients were very fresh and easy to cook; even for someone who is far from being a cordon bleu.  The meats and dumplings are a must!..There is a self service soft drinks fountain  and water pitchers to take to your table; also some desserts. Traditional jasmin tea could also make part of the menu; so it would make it a bit more traditional in addition to the very western option......There are many options of food; and all of them are delicious and one doesn't feel too bloated after realizing we ate that much!..Decor also is interesting especially; a mural depicting an ancient mongolian scene and a column with inscriptions in mongolian characters.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,ppUS3G3bVNNqvjAKsi1BbA,C4ZH9sOq-LduIbug-ZM1wA,4,Good selection and the broth is amazinggggg *O*.I personally don't think the dinner price is worth it since it is pricier; but it does include seafood and dessert. If you're more into the meat and noodles like me; go for the lunch menu--your wallets will thank you. Overall I still find the food delicious and would definitely go back here again! (: yumyum
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,5essxK53f6WjjtTXl9qpBA,RSxfmZJ21YnwIG9r3XmKTg,5,Broth is great; restaurant smells amazing; options seem endless; and the ingredients are fresh. This hot pot joint appealed to everyone in our party and was a hit for first timers. Would recommend!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,JLdxmsngE7cjrwNT7zqgyQ,-tF5GPn27kZxkN2ferqPNQ,3,This is my first Hot Pot experience that I have tried in Montreal. ..First rule of Hot Pot:.- Wear clothes that don't matter; or that you can burn after; especially if you chill at hot pot..Second Rule of Hot Pot:.- Biting into a whole clove of Anise when you aren't expecting it; is horrifying and leaves your mouth numb; and could potentially cause face wrinkles from the face that you make..Third Rule of Hot Pot:.- Bring friends; because the more the merrier..So knowing that; basically if you like putting food in hot soup and then eating it; this is both entertaining and fun. Drinks are unlimited in refills; as is food. I don't really get the onion rings in the front; with the triangular samosas... but sometimes when you are in Montreal; you try to look past that; and pretend its not there...Things to do after hot pot: host a clothing burning bonfire.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,WR3eZ4tuyXaRWC2epO7EhA,nZKJPgUUXPVswc6X7bX-zQ,3,I've been to many hot pots and this was a very different one than I am used to going to. Located in Montreal's China Town; we were taken for a little tour in the dirtiest part of the city (and this city is probably the cleanest city Ive been to). You could instantly recognize that this was a hot spot by the many people flocking in and out of the establishment. ..The first thing I liked about this style of hot pot is that its buffet. Unlike most hot pots where they serve you a certain selection of veggies that they hand picked for you; you get to choose exactly what vegetables and how much you want to put in your pot. That being said; I am not really sure how fresh the veggies are being displayed open deli style right near their front entrance. Hordes of children and families were running around using their hands when utensils were not readily available and I did not see one staff member come out to replace stale food. .We were told that we HAD to order the beef/lamb combo (I don't eat lamb) which left my boyfriend having to eat the whole dish. This wouldn't have been a problem if we didn't see the sign on the table that said if we wasted 200 grams of food; we would be charged another 15;99$ So basically; he filled up on food he didn't want just so I could eat the food I did want. I was not very happy about that but he seemed to be okay with it. ..Overall; I would have given this 2 stars because it wasn't that fantastic. I gave it a 3 because if you enjoy hot pots like I do; this is something you will want to experience regardless.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,dRbyCLGcPtXZph8Cl5zXEg,QkYhSGOce4U1erXCWAk-sQ,4,Little sheep est conçu pour les fanatiques de fondues. Chaque table est muni d'une plaque chauffante sur laquelle vous faites mijoter les aliments de votre choix; dans le bouillon de votre choix. C'est un all you can eat donc; vous pouvez recommander autant de fois que vous le souhaitez. Les boissons gazeuses sont à volonté elle aussi. Ce n'est peut-être pas les aliments des plus frais; mais il faut se souvenir que c'est un buffet à environ 20$ par personne! C'est un bon rapport qualité prix. Le service est convenable. L'endroit est propre; spacieux et le décor est plutôt moderne. Prévoyez sentir après... l'odeur des épices restent imprégnée dans les vêtements! C'est  un restaurant à essayer; du moins pour l'expérience!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,KYV3TpJiJB2LGN9umfmsHg,-vjouq2OSLz5izDEKbFlmg,1,I only go here because my mom likes this restaurant; but honestly I think it lacks in quality. I went with my mom and boyfriend 2 weeks ago and the mushrooms had dirt on it. It looked like those mushrooms have never been washed...at all.  Also the cauliflower had black mold on it. It's pretty disgusting. I don't understand why they even decided to put those out there on the rack of fresh food to put in your hot pot. Did they even bother checking?..I have nothing else to say except to add that the waiters look like they are very unhappy to work there.  I really highly recommend those who want to try (if you really have to)  the hot pot to eat with caution. And for the rest of you who want to just eat hot pot; avoid this restaurant at all costs. They do not take hygiene or safety measures in mind.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,tTaA9uk-xV-Cl6LxZ0-DFA,0BeA2MlL8QrGrxmi1dzG7g,2,Sorry; 我必須說這是我吃過最差的一家小肥羊。麻醬是苦的，沙茶醬有股怪味道，沒有腐乳和韮菜花。清湯還ok; 但紅湯只是在清湯的基礎上加了辣椒而已，根本沒有味道。店內80%人講英語。這家店根本不是給中國人開的，這水准䑃老外還行。
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,eBtaFIQcrnNAo2QW9GhRwQ,RAp4UaEzNW_5trUe6VhdJQ,5,Greetings all; who; likes good outings. This restaurant has fresh vegetables (oriental or otherwise) and seafood selections (specially; the shrimp is very sweet). The mushroom selection is outstanding whether is oriental or domestic. The fish is nice and come clean and fresh. The pot is not too spicy and tasted good. The ice cream and juice is included if you have palace for them. The surroundings are nice. The parking is difficult though. The waiter; explained what you will be having and the different prices. No; smile though from the cashier which we will let go this time. Check; the china town surroundings very nice specially the meditation.  If you are meat lover; you will like it there also; since there is a wide selections of meat chicken lamp and sausages do not forget the ice cream specially the chocolate (dark and less fat and sugar) . Nice place all around and healthy.  The children should enjoy it specially the fact that you will drink the soup after all gets cooked in it. Very clean and nice that is why I let it go a little on service. Enjoy outing in Montreal downtown .
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,ATL0HWfjFKSPEUPfme4mqw,jjUGMXAbiwNEAi6bSS4x5A,2,Demoting to a two star - service is inattentive and rude. Saw one waiter ask why the man of a couple wasn't paying for this female companion. Had to get up more than ten times to get water; place an order; ask them to refill the broth. Then I leave them a small tip to reflect this and the waiter demanded I leave them more. Smh. If you wanted a higher tip you probably should have been a better waiter. .....Original review: ..Pretty good hot pot. ..Wish they would have better sides though and a better system to get sauces.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,tB6vkXCS_8PIh-T9g8t6IQ,VnHas4Hn9A4PTNPXOw5wzg,1,Filthy; to start. The floor was beyond disgusting. Broth was like recycled dishwater; and the fish was not fresh. The rest was tasteless. Sauces were bad...I can't believe that even the hoisin was gross...I did not know that was possible. Dessert was canned fruit which was the highlight. Second worse meal of my life; worst in Montreal. My boyfriend and I left nauseous and it cost $45 for the two of us. STAY AWAY!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,Pzft5lIw1gBKyGFVHubwnw,8JZBTRk1dKx2nFqevq_kjg,5,$22 all you can eat hot pot with amazing broth and amazing lamb? Hell yes!..Their clear broth is among the best I've had in US and Canada. It's so good that one can enjoy it without any dipping sauce. And the lamb - sliced super thin and ultra tender. It takes less than 10 seconds to cook and just melts in your mouth. ..For $22; I would say they have a pretty nice variety of selections - anywhere from tofu; veggies; to mushroom; beef; fish balls; shrimp; rice cake; and noodles. But my two favorite items other than the lamb were the handmade noodles (remember; get that instead of the udon! Way better); and the quail eggs. I would be living in paradise if I could only having the lamb; the noodles; the quail eggs; and some veggies cooked in the rich broth everyday! ..A lot of people on Yelp complained about the service. However; I didn't have any issue with service (maybe they have now improved?). The two male waiters who helped us were both friendly and attentive and our orders always came within a couple minutes. Now I just wish I lived it Montréal so that I can come back more!!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,EA-Ekcj1_OCh0Qe3AsVWow,5,Little Sheep is the perfect place to go for lunch on a cold and chilly winter afternoon. If the soup doesn't warm you up; the spicy broth definitely will. This is my second time eating at a Little Sheep chain and this one was even better than the one in the States. It's buffet style so it would behove you to load up on the meat. The lamb is the best; followed by the beef. I also recommend getting a half and half spicy and normal broth. I only cook the meat in the spicy broth and everything else on the other side. This place also has a wide selection of vegetables; different types of tofu and mushrooms as well as a variety of noodles to select from. You can also help yourself to drinks at the soda fountain and they have an array of delicious desserts. I think I ate five or six freshly made mini sesame balls. I loved everything about this place from the quick service to the clean and modern look of the dining room. And the best part was how cheap it was for a buffet. Lunch came out to $13 + $1 weekend lunch + $2 for the spicy broth = $16. Not too shabby for a filling and satisfying lunch in the middle of Chinatown. This hot pot alone is worth the two hour drive from Vermont.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,4InQPZ5xc4rZMRxDGYdJZw,qenbNbiLnK7erK4_509MXQ,3,Totally agree with the MSG overload comment...Our experience started out from 5 star and deteriorated as the evening progressed. We spent about 2 hours in total. Service was quick and efficient. Little concerned about the raw meat being handled though.. Raw cuts of lamb; beef and especially chicken were just served as is and the waiters didn't seem to wash hands after touching the plates they were served in. Offered menus etc casually. ..The flavors... amazing at first.. but after an hour of the broth boiling; the flavors just seemed (as expected) to taste only of MSG :( ..But anyway; the experience was fun and we had a good time! Got so stuffed! My boyfriend even tried the desserts! (I was too full) He liked it very much! Some of the eclair like things barely had any cream fillings but there were some with a decent amount.. So inconsistencies there.. Same with egg rolls.. Too much of wrapper and barely any filling.. ..Note: The broth is charged extra from the AYCE. AYCE during the weekends is $20.99 per person for dinner. So it should be about $50 for 2 people roughly. .There's fountain soda serving canada dry; sprite; nestea; coke; fanta and diet coke. Included in the AYCE along with the desserts and condiments. ..They do mention charging an extra person's AYCE prices if the leftovers are over 100grams in weight. But during a busy night like Saturday night; they barely check since there's a wait at most times. They don't seem to take reservations either...So bottom-line: worth a visit for the experience. Enjoy while the flavors last! Recommend garlic beef and chicken :)
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,TtZgoGyZoW5-W2HLYKq2wQ,4,Hotpot? Check! All-you-can-eat? Check! ..I discovered this place several years ago and have been visiting ever since. Gone is the buffet-style; you'll now find the whole restaurant has been renovated and re-designed. You now order each item from a menu that you fill out; and the overall quality of the items has gone up from what I remember. Everything tasted fresh (beef; lamb; shrimp; squid; mussels; vegetables; tofu; fish; sausage; noodles) and was presented quite nicely. What you lose by not being able to pick 1 piece of an item; you gained in quality. You can still self-serve soft drinks and mix up your own dipping sauce. .There are also desserts available with no charge (ice cream; sesame balls; canned fruit) and some items to buy for an additional charge..Overall I think this system is an improvement and am already thinking about going back in a couple of weeks.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,uFTuvttpQvWz-V_4nncrFQ,4flbDVdlzGpSoIHwFAMcng,4,The food is fantastic! There are plenty of options for those who like spicy or not; lots of meat and vegetable options and there is a dessert table too. Only reason I do not give it a 5 star rating is because of the lack of service. It took almost 20 minutes after my party was seated before a server came to us and it took another 40 minutes for our items to come out. It was during the week and there were approximately only 6 other tables in the restaurant that were occupied. If you wish to visit this place; be prepared to wait
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,XEMBXhOY72bdthCySV3vig,3,I have been to over five different locations of the Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot; including the headquarter restaurant in Inner Mongolia (China). In Montreal; service is probably the restaurant's biggest weakness. Waiters/waitresses are overworked and don't seem to care much about customer service. The first order typically comes the fastest; so order ALL of what you want from the very beginning. There's no guarantee for the following orders - it might take 15 mins... or 40. If the food hasn't arrived after a while; enquire about it. Last time we went; our second order was simply forgotten; and the waitress shrugged when asked about it. Given the number of times that it happened; I began to suspect that delaying/losing orders is a sneaky way to decrease overall food consumption...The food itself is consistent; as Little Sheep is a chain store that uses pre-prepared packages for the broth. You can even buy it in Chinese groceries and make hot pot at home! Because all-you-can-eat lamb is so awesome; the non-existent customer service is usually tolerated...Prices are not cheap; but its definitively filling. I wouldn't recommended this place if there was anything better nearby; but I guess it's ok for sudden hot pot cravings.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,XK5NeMRDrwqSa9XQIWyskA,rXC3-u3tWGjiPbcgTLAkrA,4,Decouvrir des restaurants avec un concept innovant ou simplement different de ce qu'on voit en Amerique du Nord est un de mes passe temps favoris et je suis chanceuse d'avoir une 'amie ideale qui fait m'en decouvrir tout le temps dans la ville. Alors pour cette fois-ci;  c'est un restau de fondu asiatique que mon amie me fait decouvrir un soir d'hiver glaciale. Deja j'adore la nourriture asiatique;  ensuite le concept de base inclus une soupe epicee! SOLD.  Je vous explique le concept : Les tables sont toutes munies d'une plaque de cuisiniere avec une temperature ajustable ( touch screen please; voir photo ) et vous choisissez un bouillon dans lequel vous pourrez tremper differents aliments a deguster. Le choix est vaste et delicieux : des lanieres de viandes de boeuf et d'agneau + du poisson; des calamars + un assortiment de legumes et bien d'autres accompagnements comme du tofu ( Prenez en sans hesitation) ou encore des nouilles par exemples ! Tout y est bon sans exception...Quant au lieu; le resto se trouve en plein coeur du quartier chinois. En y entrant; on y decouvre une grande salle lumineuse en haut d'un escalier - un espace ideal pour aller manger en groupe d'amis ou en tete a tete!  Le prix est a considerer - peut atteindre presque 30$ ( tips inclus) par personne dependant des journees je crois bien mais pour l'experience; je crois que cela en vaut la peine! Le service est rapide et efficace mais sans plus. ..Pour le reste; je vous laisse decouvrir - ce n'est pas un coup de coeur mais c'est different - et cela peut toujours ameliorer notre routine quotidienne :). Je le recommande! ..Perso; j'y ferais certainement un tour une autre fois avant la fin de l'hiver!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,I0wjpE7x13V_BK4qRbm19Q,nM21lsDBGClV15OQnuXsiQ,3,Absolutely a fun time with a group! I've been to the Brossard location and the Chinatown location. They both have different styles. Brossard is modern and casual; and the Montreal location is a little more for a night out with friends; and you can dress up. ..On the second floor of the building; depending on when you go; hard to find parking. You'll need to go up the stairs and I didn't see any handicap access ramp or an elevator.  The place isn't that large but can accommodate a group...Brossard location; you have to leave your table and choose your own foods to cook; so there's limited staff to help...Montreal location has a very friendly and helpful staff.  You choose the foods that you want and they bring it to your table. ..They had a few different food choices such as garlic beef; so be sure to ask what they have that Brossard doesn't have. ..All of the food was really fresh and the portions to share were very adequate. There can be a fee if you waste too much but they didn't charge us so it seems quite within reason...The meat was a lovely quality; they have lamb and chicken as well. There's an extra lamb shank that you can order outside of the all you can eat price. The lamb shank was very good; a little small to share with more than one person. It was well seasoned and we all tried it and enjoyed it. ..The handmade noodles were so yummy; we all enjoyed the ramen noodles and please have the long flat rice noodles; so chewy; just lovely! ..There are plenty of sauces too! ..The Sake came warm and they poured it for us and directed us to keep it on the heating plate; yaaaasss!..The desserts at this location were very dried out; but in their defence; we arrived an hour before closing. But they had Sesame cakes; so delicious; that were perfect and soft; almost gooey. I could have just eaten sesame cakes for dinner!  Brossard location didn't have sesame cakes...We had a fun evening; and they have some hard liquor; beer and Sake; where Brossard only has beer...The website says that they have Mochi; but on close examination; I see they don't have it in Canada. I also asked to make sure; and they didn't even seem to know what Mochi was....At closing they came to us with last call for food and drinks. We left with full tummies. Would definitely go back to this location before tee Brossard location. Mainly because I enjoy getting dressed for dinner and going downtown. If I were going for a lunch with kids; I'd go to the Brossard location instead...Afterwards we had bubble tea at a little place just outside their door. Try the green tea and peach with lychee jelly! I asked for more green tea and less peach; very sweet if not. ..Great place to bring friends and family for a new experience.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,FX_srmY437yj75Ax9xVkHQ,OJP5dwwFcRA266iEKtCO9A,2,Pro:..- Has lamb fondu meat slices as option. Has an good selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian hotpot selection...- Polite; attentive staffs...- Near the metro; in the center of Chinatown...Con:..- Their sea-food product; tofu and mushroom selections smells disgusting; and most definitely capable of inducing food poisoning on a given day...- Their soft drinks tastes weird; in a left too long in the sun and diluted sorta way...- Awful desert selection; you only have 2-3 choices and 2 of them taste funky; in a left too long on the counter sense...-Disgusting washroom..Summary:.Stick to the meat and veggies; bring your own drink; don't use their washroom. And cook everything throughoutly yourself before putting it in the mouth.  ..This place is a germ central
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,1lRbzzJ5yXGq6K0CpUCbMw,44OauAwaxBws18rT439cPw,3,This is the same Little Sheep Hot Pot that has spread across China becoming the Chinese equivalent to say Olive Garden or maybe comparing it to Sizzler's is more accurate. Even though this is the same restaurant; it's been localized for better or worse. ..To begin with; it's buffet style. Grab your plate and walk up to the front and pile on the food.  Seafood only makes an appearance for dinner; which is why the evening price is quite a bit more. The front has a section of fountain drinks to choose from and a variety of pre-cooked snacks. The pre-cooked stuff is OK when fresh; but mediocre to bad once the egg rolls; onion rings and other items get cold...The selection of vegetables is acceptable; but again this is where the localization impacts things. The veggies and mushrooms are all very safe; nothing is too exotic and this can of course be extended to the meats and seafood which all remain very acceptable to western palettes. ..This is probably the best hot pot restaurant in Montreal but is pretty mediocre as far as authentic hot pot is concerned. During my last visit some of the seafood was called into question and we were getting a pretty awful stench from an unidentified location. I'll go back for sure and I'll even recommend it to others; but remember you are dealing with raw meat and seafood and vegetables in a buffet environment so be on-guard for any suspect food.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,guwfsykYJ19-BWWn3EzP-w,xdAYv7r7C4PUJdQjuUJi9A,4,this is the closest thing i have found to the hot pot i loved so much in Taiwan. and i have searched hi and lo. this place offers a choice of herbal broth; spicy broth; or a combo. husband & i wanted it all; so we got the combo. they set the pot on your table; fire up the electric range underneath; and offer you a plate of beef or lamb slices. herein lies my only real complaint - no vegetarian option available for the soup. we loosen up when we travel; preferring not to miss out on too much of the food culture when visiting a new destination; but it makes me sad that vegetarians are not be able to partake of this fantastic dining experience. if you can get past the both issue; the buffet has piles of fresh greens - spinachES; bok choyS - as well as tofuS; mushroomS; noodles; broccoli; gluten; veggies i could not identify; all wonderful. we spent an hour or so making and eating our lunch (WAY cheaper than dinner). others were eating when we got there and still going strong when we left. loved it & still haven't stopped raving about it.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,zzKsgIF472IyDpJxmHDIpw,vUyBb-sikEu-7jrKpwS_4Q,5,This is my fav place. Their broth is amazing. Very deph in flavor; and a soothing aftertaste; pleasant on it's own; which is very fun to drink at the end of the meal. My sis was starting a cold; but it got zapped away from all those herbs in their broth. Awesome comfort food. Spicy Heaven...I bought their broth package from a grocery store that had this restaurants logo on it; and it was not the same at all. It was just the basic base :oil; salt; fermented soy beans; berries; and chemicals; the restaurant adds a lot more herbs to their version; and you can clearly see it. I inspected a large seed in the restaurnts broth; even bit into it; and it was a eucalyptus seed; which explains why it zapped my sis's cold. They probably put in a lot of other herbs too; which is why I always feel so good after :3 I love their broth xp..A lot of fun variations in their menu; even when they've ran out of certain items. Their lotus root and cow stomach (lower/softer tripe?) are my fav items; never tried them before experimenting here xp..Their blood pudding was bland; and their baby squid was tough as well as their rice cakes because I don't know how to cook all of these lol So better order what you know about. But after looking on youtube; I'm going to try the rice cakes again; and cook them much longer...They refill your pot with non-spicy broth (always on time for us). Since we always get the half non spicy and half spicy broth; which is usually very spicy (yet amazing); I think next time I want to try to ask for the same half divided pot; but both sides with their spicy broth so i can separate the seafood from the land meats. Their non spicy broth is good; but I prefer the fire broth cause it has a nice kick to it :) Would be nice if they could place all the large chilli peppers in a tied mesh bag though; as well as their other large seasoning pieces; so it's easier to find our smaller added items. (Fk it; I'm emailing them lol)..Like all AYCE places; they forget parts of our order; but after awhile; I caught on why. We order too much in one order; so it makes sense that they try to help out by leaving some out so that we're not stuck with force feeding ourselves so we don't get stuck with paying for left overs that we can't take home. Was annoying at first; until I actually appreciated it by the end when I would get too full to finish. It's just best to go slow and try not to order too much on each round...They have a make your own diping sauce area. Not labbeled though; which is bad for me; cause I don't know what I'm doing; and made a disaster. I had to beg the waiter to make me one; and what he brought me was BOOM awesome! I tipped him extra just for that to encourage them for the next time my dumbass comes in lol or at least label it. I guess they never had a problem with labeling because the people who go there already know what everything is; since it's not knew to them...This may be my fav place; but my family doesn't like coming here as often as I do because they don't like loosing food in the broth and having to find it. It would be nice to have a type of net to hold small items together so that we can stop them from overcooking easier or at least put them on scewers; I don't know. I wonder if they would let us bring our own.....Seating is comfortable; service is fast as long as the place is not full. Careful about ordering a lot; it's hard to fill the small tables; so pace yourself since you don't want to waste anyways. Suggest to save the noodles for last; to get the flavor of all the ingredients you added...The Buffet station is where you get your desert; make dipping sauce; and free soft drink refils. Desert are simple crispy pastries; but good with the heated sweetened condensed milk you get to pour yourself; nothing to really brag about; just helps with digestion after. But the best round pastries run out; so I don't suggest you go late if you care for it...Because I'm tempted to eat so much here; it's better to go early and spend the rest of the day burning off everything eaten. If you're not a big eater; 30$ is a lot of money but worth it if interested in having many diff items that are normally separated because they're expensive. This is a nice place to take your time and eat slow in; really enjoy your conversation with your peers and have fun managing the food in the hotpot...I wish we could take the remaining broth to go home with; it's that good! But they don't allow it; probably because they rather people pay to eat there. But for someone like me who doesn't eat out often; it would have been nice; instead of them throwing it out...I would love it if they had the stretchy type of rice cakes here! I think they can be frozen; so I'm sure they could manage it.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,PALLpd-wFfmp48inCockgg,KQ4FQR4cNnppnimBYuxa7A,3,This was the second time I came to this restaurant. It is a hot pot buffet restaurant; so you can eat as much as you can. We did not eat that much though. The lamb and beef were good. The downside of eating here was the clothes were full of hot pot smell. It would be better if they could supply cloth covers like commonly seen in hot pot restaurants.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,yWvnZGvlKMip_QWIp8sB9w,ULV0zxV_jWmTaaMgMt6pVw,1,I have to sign up an account to say something. I'm traveling to Montreal for a few days. I was excited to try out the hot pot over this place. It was on 6/10/17 around 9:40 pm. Me and my friend saw this place on yelp so we walked in. There is a young man by the front desk greeting us. We want a table for 2 people. But he said they are closing. I checked the time they put on yelp is 11:30 pm; he said it should be at 11pm. This is the first mistake that they made; because it could mislead all customers who want to eat hot pot and come here after they close. It is a big disappointing. Second; even they close at 11 pm; there is no way they reject people by 1 hour ahead they close. We just have to walked away. I don't understand why they do that; probably the worker want to get off early so they don't want more customer to come in. So I'm just writing this review to let people know that if you want to come here at night; maybe you should manage your time ahead.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,O1iuRw2PH5sxqENbE7m4Bg,Taa2NX2GuETcoWeizFqQDw,1,This was the worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant. The restaurant was only 5% full as we were there; the young lady insisted to put us in a awkward place for our party of 5 with a toddler. The explanation was that otherwise the toddler would be injured and they cannot be responsible for; which was the most rude and not considerate explanation. When she started to bring food; she rudely put the three plates of raw beef and lamb on the table on top of our plates and chopsticks which got our chopsticks fallen all over the places. She did not apologize at all. After I called her back since my chopsticks were put on the raw meat; I needed a replacement; she impatiently brought me a new one. I also explained to her that please avoid putting the raw food right infront of my 2 year old; she said that you could replace it yourself. ..The food is so so. The overall service was bad cause we had to self serve for many things; water; soy milk; etc. and had to.ask for food for many times before they bring them.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,HOgwZIHBA_c5zsWTJB6r2Q,ieRvsx7x-CzKQnwkTq2F6g,1,The stuff at cashier must be a joke; I accidentally skipped the tip. And the guy at cashier seems really angry with me. And asked me to pay 10-15% tip.  The food is mediocre; not worth my time. I had light diarrhea after a few hours. I can never forget that man's face. What a hater.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,aNfG4yqETNKXNQgc2qTToA,5DDPalIJSjmTr1tlNulXqA,2,Only come here if you don't care about how you smell afterward. .After you eat here; there is a strong odour that comes with you afterward. .Their food tasted okay; but I heard people had diarrhea afterward; maybe their food is not that fresh...
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,Synp0WYQsIdlaSWHvrxe0g,Mip5_vu9qf7aJn0P-rrEbA,1,Horrible service;very slow and not fresh food;go to Brossard one;way much better! We went there for the lunch;the wait stuff constantly miss our orders and impolite; never return
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,q01khtt3I3bWBvHGxwA6vA,pqTR5UQHCJ3NK_rOlgv9dQ,4,Great find thx to yelp!  Took the fam here over new years holiday and totally got a great experience!  The veggies are fresh and the price is right!  Take a group and have fun...watch out for the garlic though it'll blow u away! Oh and be sure to have sesame balls for dessert...and put sauce on them & by sauce I mean the yellow bottle of sweetened condensed milk!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,XlIbzoFtJioMtKWWqtXKWA,OPcYQy_Dwvai40Uyv13-HA,2,We were a party of 9 on a stormy winter night. They were very short on servers. They didn't tend to us at all; and we had to go find them all the time. Fortunately; we had a chinese speaker in the group; which made it slightly better. The food was good; but the service was definitely not good.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,4nB3xLwTF6lQnnWJmVQC7w,-gM4I9CpzPwlqT7LD1-dUQ,5,great food and price;customer service  isnt bad as in other review:we went there on a busy sunday lunch time and the waitress was nice with us . tip for chinese buffet beginners：if you cant see the food you ordered for 30min+ just reorder it; there is only 5% chance that they didnt forgot your order
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,8V8jkz6Ns0efDR-eUnxM6Q,5jaoJP-YwYxDVRLvUnIH4A,5,Where to start?! Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot is an amazing restaurant for any occasion; the choices in the buffet are broad; waiters are nice and will not take time to bring you what you ask; it's a very interesting style of buffet (won't spoil the surprise for you!) and it's a very nice atmosphere for all occasions. Highly recommended!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,gTkr9qQwv5e_7zEqOQKPLg,5,ATMOSPHERE: It's a decently sized restaurant on a corner in Chinatown on the second floor. As soon as you walk in; your nose will be overwhelmed with the amazing smells of their hotpot broth. Be warned though: your clothes WILL smell like hotpot when you leave! ..FOOD: Delicious and fresh. I love their lamb. Also; their menu has a LOT of variety which is really cool. For a buffet style restaurant; I'm really impressed with their portions; quality and variety. I would definitely recommend this spot; especially in the winter time. It warms you up and fills you up!..PRICE: Nice price for the amount of food that you can eat; the variety and the quality. ..SERVICE: Pretty good service. It's a busy restaurant so it's a little bit hard to flag a waiter down.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,Jon2aajFsTLdHUzVlsDFhQ,NjDiyfMVrEPBabjRSMB3KA,3,The new format renders averse the proper condition of self serving bliss. The establishment now uses the same instance of most AYCE sushi. The waiters attend the tables as sheet orders are filled. The menu list is abbreviated to vegetables; noodles; and two kind of meats(beef and lamb). Disappointed.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,zZ9U1tujzFHGChIj5CuDNw,5oczLuLe_e8OYuH6cE5caQ,2,I've always wanted to try hotpot at a restaurant and the opportunity came along when a friend of mine invited me to eat with her because before that I have only had home made hot pots; like tons and of all sorts. So I was very disappointed at the broths. She took the spicy and I took the non spicy one and neither one was to my satisfaction. Price was $20 all you could eat but when something isn't to your standards then all you can eat doesn't do much for you. The service was horrible. We waited over a half an hour to get anything. No broth no veggies no meat. Nothing.  There were people there who arrived after who got theirs within 10 mins. I was so upset. I ended up grabbing cups and plates from a different table myself. When I asked our waitress why it was taking so long she just said okay smiled fakely and walked off. I am a very generous tipper but when service is as horrible as that; I do not tip at all. Some people may be ashamed to do that but I'm not and I would like the workers to know that they do not deserve any more than that one visit I gave them.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,PSNbprTFGBE84xZLAKFGTg,ARSCmrvEGyEA7XusCXjkpg,2,Four stars for the good taste. Not that authentic as the one in mainland China; but it is still a good choice for a hot pot in Canada...One star for the very bad service. What's with the waitress? She talked in a very rude way and even yelled at us!!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,VVKPN_N3M3DKA-2an10HSA,c-X9l2jt9wbyavZqzwtD-g,2,Food was good but service ruined it. On the door it states it closes at 10:30pm;  got there at 9:00pm and were super rushed! We were made the pay at our table before we were even finished. One of the servers started mopping; placed smelled like bleach-put me off my food. The turned away a group at 9:30- why state that you're open until 10:30 when you're not. I told the host our feedback - she didn't seem to care; smiled and nodded.  Better hotpot down the street - kagayaki; with more respectful staff.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,mIo8ojzyMrAnq_mxjmisfw,pCSTrKV-hYvk8sNV4pHqlg,4,This is by far my best dining experience in Montreal!  I went there for the first time this summer and I plan to go back!    I had never done hot-pot before so I didn't know what to expect.  The idea:  You have big pot of broth which cooks at your table (table has a hot plate; so no open flame) and you dip things in there to cook them and then pop into your mouth for instant nirvana!..The details:  $25 per table (add $4 for spicy broth); add table fee; add more money for meat.  Total = $50 for my hubby and I and well worth it...1) Choose broth:  You can get a clear or spicy broth or both (divider in pot keeps them separate.  We got both and I must say the spicy broth is much better..2) Choose meats (extra):  We got beef and lamb.  Both were thinly sliced and tasted amazing when cooked in the broth.  . 3) Take plate and walk around buffet adding items to cook in the pot..4) Dip items in hot liquid; blow to cool them off; pop in mouth. Nom; Nom; Nom!..The place was crowded and noisy but I didn't really mind.  The food was that good!  It was just such a wonderful experience to try all the different items from the buffet (mussels; prawn; chinese brocoli; bok choy; bamboo shoot; baby corn as well as the thinly sliced meats).   It was quite a selection!  There is a photo of me that my husband took which makes me look like quite a bad mother! My daughter is lying next to me in the booth; and I am ignoring her and stuffing my face with food.  ..I didn't give this place a five-star because well; it isn't fine-dining but it's good.  I recommend it.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,0a1ckGnH8663w6gS4S77ng,1,This Mongolian hot pot place in Chinatown is really not good; the food is not so fresh and the smell of the hot pot will stick on your clothes and never go away. I find the choices of meat and vegetable quite limited compared to the one in south shore; and plus this restaurant is just too small to be set up as a hot pot restaurant; it's simply suffocating; to avoid at all cost!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,b-xbzrwrqy31Sia1pajPxA,53w6WD84uJdrBrKMaKjL_w,5,My absolute favorite part about our trip to Montreal was the food! After touring the Basilique Notre-Dame; my boyfriend and I wandered through China Town and stumbled upon a bright neon sign with a cute little lamb. We weren't quite sure what we were getting into but decided this would be the place to eat. ..Neither one of us had heard of hot pot and we were quite intrigued by the convection stove tops at each table. (This was before we discovered Korean bbq) The waiter brought out a menu with pictures...first you choose your broth- regular or spicy. I like trying anything new so we got both. Then you have your choice of different raw meats to put in your pot. They bring out this huge pot with a divider so it contains both types of broth and let the broth simmer while you stock up at the buffet. They have every kind of vegetable; noodle and seafood you can think of; local as well as unidentifiable. As overzealous newbies; we each filled our plates with just about everything and piled it into the soup. The meat is brought out raw and cooks in the broth; much like Pho'.  The regular broth is not regular at all; it was very well seasoned with whole spices right in the pot. The spicy was screaming hot; but that is how to should be. It was all amazing and very; very filling...The quality of the food was great; the dining experience was really fun and I would recommend this place to anyone going to Montreal.  I heard there is a Little Sheep here in San Diego; so soon I will stop by there as well :)
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,Np-Eumi0cPgX7S2LWOC57A,jMwOJ_TSfCAC3ceWAYpiwg,2,Well; let's just put it this way: all-you-can-eat restaurants are great when you actually enjoy the food...I now know that I'm not a fan of Mongolian Hot Pot. Or; at least; not at this place. I was skeptical of the freshness of important food items such as shrimp and fish (not to mention the chicken livers); although I assume the florescent pink beef and lamb slices had so many preservatives in them that nothing could possibly spoil. Of course; I couldn't bring myself to eat the stuff...In short; being adventurous with food can sometimes be a bad thing; and in this case it was a waste of money for two hungry people; who left the restaurant unfulfilled and slightly nauseated...If you're up for the challenge; I recommend going with someone who knows what they're doing as a guide....perhaps there's a better approach to dining in this particular realm. I also recommend that you make sure that you can first handle the smell of the various seasonings in the broth before you commit to an all-you-can-eat experience...Best of luck to you!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,7Ri5xkuj6rMvD8F2zjWFow,NCFCpTFffcBgDAB4IPnvcA,3,Comparing to the one located at Brossard; this one has fall slightly short. The service is inefficient even with multiple waiters; and they always forgot my orders when I asked for more lamb slices...The condiments in the sauce section constantly lack ingredients; and the place seems to be messy and dirty almost all the time. In addition; the fried appetizers are always cold and soggy; and they rarely bother to renew it...The waiting time in a Friday or Saturday evening is utterly ridiculous. They do not accept reservations from 4-9pm (last time I checked). In addition; the lamb meat they serve sometimes are stale; and you can tell from the colour that it was not very fresh...At any rate; this place still remains one of my favourite restaurants in downtown; however I'd like to see some improvements being made.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,TZBIjCMQ684ZtNMXpoFeyQ,qvaBdR10ViNsqcVtg1xujg,5,If you have never been to a hot pot  before you should try this one!.Hotpot is the process of cooking your food in a hot boiling pot infront of you...21.99 for all you can eat dinner.+ 3 to 5 dollars for broth.3 for small.5 for large.If you share a pot with someone just gwt the regular broth in large ..they will bring it out in 2 halves one half will be spicy...Food is great!.Fresh! .Comes out fast!.Servers are patient and explain how the restaurant works in fluent english.Situated in china town montreal.Pot heats up quickly.Cooking time is fast.Free pop/ice tea.Free veggie spring rolls and peaches/pineapple on the side.They stack the dishes beside your table which is nice so you have space at your table if you are sitting at a 2 seater small table..They have noodles; tripe; veggies; potato; seafood; beef;lamb etc. I dont believe there was chicken which i am thankful for as chicken is risky if you do not cook it long enough..They fill your pot with hot water if your broth steams itself out too much..They accept cash debit and credit -pay at the bar when you are done..I would recommend walking into china town vs driving..Great experience!
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,B9hG8-Qo5Nen9GwwiywFKA,rMjJ2nSCvJ5mQ2OPGhic9Q,2,While the food was good; as well as the service; I am giving this place a two star review because of the lasting impression we were given by the cashier guy. .My man left a tip on the table; and when we went up to pay; the cashier blatantly said you have to tip minimum 10% .A) go check the table before making wild accusations .B) we don't HAVE to tip... don't make customers feel like they did something illegal if they choose not to tip.
CDzk5ayt_e86MuNlLFvLDQ,_e-eyBuq6B2VVJheAqItXg,4hDQ7BuRaLMb51Gv5gL2Ig,1,Bad customer service and also food wasnt fresh.. Also try tonorder some stuff in the menu but they didnt have....
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,O0qW-X3Y7eA2xic0I0xnFw,arnVjBR7lojm7dSlzSBkNQ,5,Great place for brunch and deserts. Kids friendly. Awesome hot chocolate! The menu was in both English and French! I had the Lazy Breakfast and my wife had the Spanish Frittata (sorry no pictures). I will post a picture of the delicious hot chocolate!
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,zOS4WDlkiLU1pddtFUBPhA,wXQF4UVkNH8eZW182KLOhw,1,Ok so in short; this place sucks... .Service: This place has the worst service I have ever encountered. The host and servers seem like they're forced to work at this restaurant. I hope the owner/manager reads this and has some serious training for the staff. The host basically discouraged us (8 people) from sitting down and eating; and told us up front that they had many limited dishes and that our plates would come out at different times. We had initially intended to go to L'Avenue but the line was out the door and it was -20 outside so NOPE. After being seated we order coffee and the server brings everyone their coffee in a mug but mine which was brought out in a paper cup. She said we do not have any more mugs when 5 minutes later I witnessed the table next to me with a mug. There was never a smile cracked by the server which is cool everyone could be having a bad day; but it seemed as if she was upset that she was even working. Every answer was short and dry. The coffees came with one sugar packet and when we asked for more the server was annoyed. They didn't bring out sufficient water cups so we had to ask the server 4 times for that as well. When clearing the table; the server looked at me annoyed almost as if she wanted me to help her clean. DO NOT GO HERE.  .. ..Side note: couple next to me left without eating because one of them received their meals and the other didn't have anything in front of them for 30 mins..Food: The feel-good omelet was alright; the bacon was super undercooked and the eggs lacked flavor. I wouldn't say the food was that bad but it also wasn't anything that I would come back for if everything else was good... ..Ambience was just about the only thing that was cool. It had a nice Café vibe to it; and the décor and artwork inside is cool
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,jUWhP2TbG6yFKBFOmW-9-w,3,The food was just meh. Nothing really special tasting about it. Which is a bummer because I remember cacao 70 being a really good chain for dessert meals...Service is incredibly slow even though there are no customers. Only two people were working (waiter and cook) on the Thursday night we visited so they know this location is usually empty. So I can understand why it was slow...I ordered the chocolate banana waffle and the portion is big; I couldn't even finish. The little chocolate pebbles were very tasty; and the melted chocolate on the side was great with my waffle; the ice cream was meh (I did ask for chocolate flavoured because I don't like vanilla ice cream that much but he must've forgotten); the waffle was a big soggy; and the banana was normal.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,5JGXBQD8vCRRtB9vHBDJsg,0s7PEdiKTuC-GgPoyaVPKw,5,This place is absolutly delicious ! If you like desert and chocolate this is the place for you..I took the black and white chocolate fondue with fruits and brownies. Just to think about it and i want to go back again !
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,7JPca3EB6gJ_eDKC-3Ehkw,REBOQasZFIgMHL2XBLYv2g,3,Food and service were very good.  Nothing too extraordinary in their brunch menu but it did the trick!  Excellent that they have a kids menu and offered crayons and paper to the kids - don't see that often!
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,cUKuQRcr7Ln6GwDZrRHdwg,4Jza61o2hZZDXeyxmLtV1g,4,I saw previous reviews before and pretty much everyone was complaining about the wait time but I was lucky because the place was empty so we got amazing service and it was fast...The girl working there was super great and went beyond to give us the best experience ever. We had a hot chocolate and a single fondue but it's plenty enough for 2 people to share. The wifi was down that day so I believe it might be the reason why it was so quiet because I saw a few people walking out and also the debit machine was down...The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is this is the only location without a liquor license and we were not aware of this and we went there with Bailey's on our mind. So be aware of that if it is on your mind as well. The waitress told us that the other franchise do have the liquor license.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,APM0_XAaCJks8bq_pMupgA,BykrC-26SDDItaQdbEZTag,1,J'ai commandé ce jour une gaufre choco noisette; venant assez régulièrement je savais ce qu'il devait arriver dans mon assiette. Surprise ce jour l'assiette est arrivée; froide; les gaufres molles et pas assez cuite; la glace fondu; une montagne de crème chantilly pour camoufler le tout. J'ai demandé à me faire changer l'assiette; il m'a été dit que cela été impossible car j'avais goûté l'assiette pour couronner le tout la table que j'avais était bancable personne n'a souhaité la mettre à niveau ! ..Vraiment déçu; dernière fois que je viens
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,DNI-bQKlmG8_qI1Ou03HIw,rQqTlU5xwZ2MjR0uv2Lukw,3,This was overhyped. I was expecting better; but it was still good. Probably wouldn't go again though.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,mADOdA77frBzP5OT-IaZMA,5gZJTDPjQheWnaU3EQNlrg,1,Ended up in this restaurant after ditching L'Avenue because of their long line. What a mistake that was. It looks very promising from the outside and when you sit down; but everything goes downhill from there. Service was atrocious. They took approximately over 45 minutes preparing our food when the restaurant was empty. The server took forever to take our order and was never around when we needed anything. Usually when i wait this long; I always think the food is going to compensate for the wait; but no; food was actually horrible. Four of the five plates we ordered were cold. I ordered the Meat Lovers Omelette. The omelette was dry and flavorless even with all the meats. :/ Two other people in our table ordered the Lazy Breakfast and it looked doleful. It barely had any eggs and it didn't look appetizing. Needless to say they weren't please with their food. Overpriced food; very long wait time and bad service. No thank you!
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,NrnaYqXZsWzO1maOiwurhQ,ziTW2pqr3vVh4HVl-Zs-PA,2,Grosse déception ! J'étais habitué et content du Cacao 70 de la rue Sainte-Catherine; mais là... .La nourriture était correcte mais le service laissait à désirer : il y avait manifestement un problème en cuisine entraînant un temps  d'attente élevé et plutôt que de nous l'indiquer à notre arrivée (ce qui a été fait pour certains clients); nous avons patienter 25 minutes pour nos boissons chaudes et près d'une heure pour l'assiette...
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,2_mSppyp2y08wUTrVPKnNg,IZLTa9Unghys_i2tuQkJLQ,3,3.5 stars. I need to try this location again; but not for Sunday brunch. I get the Montreal's weekend brunch culture is popular and therefore restaurants become very hectic but there was no organization practiced here at all. I thought we were lucky to be seated right away and on the patio! Score! Except we were surrounded by tables of really needy types of tourists. So my table of two slipped the minds of the waiters I suppose and I waited at least 30 minutes for some coffee. And then waited for food. And then waited and waited for the bill. And waited while the waiter said he would get the machine but cleared tables instead. And I wouldn't be bothered by any of this if I didn't know right across the street in my view is the always busy but organized L'Avenue where even though they are super busy they take the time to give you juice and always refill your coffee. I'm not mad about the experience at Cacao 70 because everyone working there seemed new and like they had never worked a Sunday brunch rush before. And maybe they hadn't. But my lesson was learned. Don't go for breakfast. All that aside; the food was pretty good. I love chocolate so that was perfect; the crepe was okay. I wouldn't suggest ordering a side of bacon. It was that kind that is as thin as paper. Not very good. My boyfriend was satisfied by his omelette. I will try again for dessert someday in hopes of a better experience.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,iLqKVEqc1LfFlY3DZkmgXQ,a4gHjMxbeZtLWiTvJSncSw,5,Wonderful experience with great service. Must confess we came for L'Avenue but switch due to the line up..Was  unsure of due to the reviews but so glad we came..The food was outstanding and service was very good..Thanks!!
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,aNS_fOw7jMRpPOoJhDTRgg,RN9isbx08NnVz60me8aYWA,3,Came here on a Saturday morning for brunch with a group a 5. The wait was 45 minutes to be seated since it was the brunch rush. ..The service was slow because it was crowded; so beware if you are extremely hungry and you want to be seated right away. ..The food was good and tasty and even got a free fruit platter for the long wait. Everyone was extremely friendly.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,abrz3T4odmKp8ZdH8nUvFg,78vVDBsN9_W7hS9jxTuinQ,4,Cool spot in Montreal. We had never been so decided to get the sampler -- My favorite was the banana split waffle (so bomb). My friend said she really liked the fondu and pizza. .Also... Thank you for having an English menu :)
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,dMS2wyePPsJ55Xm78V62_g,Xb_q5T3RpdZiKA18JLukPA,1,If you're in a long line for L'Avenue and you're tempted to ditch the waiting and grab a bite at Cacao 70 across the street; DON'T. Sure; you'll get a seat right away and they advertise brunch; but the place is just a facade. It looks promising; but it does not deliver. ..First; the service was atrocious. We walked in and the hostess/server was standing right in front of us; but just ignored is for several minutes until we asked her if we could sit. At which point she told us to sit wherever even though the sign clearly indicated to wait to be seated. She then took forever to take our order. She even took the orders of Yankees that walked in after us first. She seemed annoyed and was not at all friendly--not even in the fake server way. Drinks took forever to come to us and all we ordered was coffee...Second; the food was terrible. We all ordered omlettes that were over cooked and dry; but also cold. I don't even understand how that's possible. Additionally; the food had zero flavor. It was extremely obvious that the cook didn't even use salt and pepper. Condiments were brought in takeout packets and we were given one each. The potatoes were cold. Not like; sitting on the counter for a while cold. More like cooked hours ago cold...Third; THEY DON'T SERVE LIQUOR. Their menu days you can add liquor to your drinks; but that was a flat out lie. Also; they don't take USD. First shit experience in MTL.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,5QrlMMzUq_RoUlEyH2zcig,2GTakYDiiSowZqAmnLZlDg,5,Visited this little spot this summer and absolutely loved it! ..The girls working; were both friendly and took time to explain the menu; gives us recommendations. ..The food was nicely prepared (see pictures) and absolutely delicious! ..They've got a beautiful sunny patio during the summer season; tons of flowers planted around. Careful for the bees if you're afraid of them. They were friendly but didn't bother us. ..Waitress was very attentive and kind. ..Great overall experience!
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,tN1kErgK9ci0WO7rsAyavw,DmX3WuWO_RD-Tp0Ip6ENMw,4,This was my favorite brunch place that I visited in the city. We were planning on going to L'Avenue just across the street; but the line was out the door; so we walked over to this place instead. All of the brunch options include a fruit and chocolate fondue; which was delicious. The cappucino was fantastic. The omelette was a little empty and could have used more ingredients; but there's a large menu so you have plenty of options.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,QH6Z-yjUG1oHsZTIzjWMcg,TlPaOOjM0hXXoweof2kFWw,2,We eight people came at 10:15 am and we were the third table in the restaurant. We waited 40mins to get our dishes. The waitress told us it's because a new chef doesn't know how to cook some dishes. If it is true; I really don't know what to say. The brunch totally turned into lunch. .The frittata my wife ordered was burnt. and she had to send it back. The brunch menu all comes with fruit w/ fondue. However; the fruit was not fresh. My friend said the pineapple tasted like alcohol. The fruits were the worst I've seen.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,8Mg5n8kUeCofQFa37EmNiw,kT9qM9MVQoawpQhYNofdXg,5,Brunch here was excellent! The place is quaint; quiet; and intimate. I brought my family here for breakfast; as it was my mother's first time in Montréal-- this really set our trip off on the right foot!

Food was fantastic- highly recommend the grilled chicken waffle sandwich; and the orange juice was super tasty too.  Bright atmosphere and nice decor.  Above all; our server Camina was the highlight of our visit.  She was efficient; accommodating and very friendly.  Highly recommend.

On avait un petit four pour faire griller nos guimauves :) La fondue au chocolat était très bonne; c'était accompagné de fraises et de bananes; mais il y en avait pas énormément. La crème glacée maison est bonne aussi. Le chocolat chaud nous a déçu; très épais et beaucoup trop sucrée. Nous avons aussi pris un chocolat chaud-froid qui etait également beaucoup trop sucrée. général très bonne expérience; nous y retournerons
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,smNWtHPk8L4W5NizIY4q_Q,4etB5JDX3zEOGFoVliPtrA,2,Service d'une lenteur infinie. J'ai pris le déjeuner des paresseux. Le bacon est du bacon préparé qu'on met au micro-ondes. Les saucisses avaient l'air infectes. Je ne me suis pas osée à les manger. Les patates semblent être du congelé. Pâteuses. Je devais avoir des fruits et une petite fondue au chocolat. Je ne l'ai jamais eu. Bref; la seule chose de bonne etait le café. Je ne retournerai jamais bruncher à cet endroit; je me suis sentie volée pour le prix; versus qualité.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,zvZ4S6NZpEF6zLWrSGOy3w,iWf-3Eu1GB0zhD8eUpA-fg,1,Don't go here. We came here for Saturday brunch. It looks cute but we waited an hour for food; half an hour just to get a cup of coffee; and when our food did arrive; my frittata was super dry. When we looked around the full restaurant; literally only two tables had food. We ended up commiserating with all the tables around us about how terrible the experience was. Some of them had waited even longer than us for food. Just go across the street and get in the line. The wait is the same but at least you get good food.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,7hElQBiE_x2HZk6yJMVgNg,ci6a3aMxfLHM7axhgZPcmg,5,love it dont know why this one is rated less high than the others; i like there strawbery shortcake parfait; chocolate drinks but dont like the pizza with marshmello its just too much.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,hPZALj8h6lsI0Yz-z_MitQ,3,Came here for dessert; ended up staying an evening!..We came in early; hoping to avoid the type of line-ups these chocolate cafes tend to create and got lucky as we were seated immediately with the only table that was available. The menus were given to us; the water of glasses were poured and then we waited...and waited...and waited.... to simply place our order...We ended up flagging her down about 25 minutes later and placed our order with authority. We didn't drive all the way here to be denied our yummies! I went with their dark Italian chocolate and we shared a chocolate fondue meal. ..The hot chocolate was perrrrrrfect; with the right amount of bitterness that made it nostalgic for me! The fondue to share for 2 was huge! SO MUCH CHOCOLATE!!! We had a great time trying everything out. For the food I give it a solid 5 stars...Did I mention we waited nearly 45 minutes for our food after we ordered? Yeah; we did. When it came to pay we simply rushed the counter to pay because we couldn't afford waiting any longer. The service was a 1 star for me; she was nice but she and the kitchen were completely overwhelmed with so many people... on a Saturday night?!? We shouldn't be here for 2 hours; heck at least ask us if we wanted anything else while we were sitting down!..If you're wondering why you're waiting 30+ minutes at the door (and when we left the line-up did stretch to outside); then this is the reason why! ..Hire more staff Cacao 70!
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,_TNqzgIWYmgdlEA2MqXTQA,iVqdwPES8ilbZDkgClQjKg,1,Cozy place; but Don't come here unless you have 50 mins of time to wait for ur foods to be served.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,GY6lkkFN-ap8AvMnKurwvA,BJdHbJKQ7BtkCrSU4lphLw,3,Had the nutella crepe with nana and strawberries. Not enough nutella for our liking though. Strawberry cheesecake was a little too tart. Good; friendly service
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,6lQ5BtSs7Egm97JASU9urw,h83DjdjBN4grS1OWxQmGwg,3,The hot chocolate is very good (albeit overpriced). But what's unbearable is the annoying commercial advertising on the radio channel that's running in the background. Awful.
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,Jov3BuUqmytq79H_RiOtPw,ZDGZXhAgSsrdUI4_A9jzag,1,Mediocre food; and service. Went to have breakfast; and ordered a 'feel good omelette' and two chicken and waffles. Overall; the food took more than thirty minutes to arrive and the omelette arrived cold and not fluffy at all. The server was not helpful at all; and overall the food quality was pretty bad. The chicken and waffles comprised of a very stingy portion of chicken breast pieces between two waffles; like a really unappetizing looking sandwich. All in all; a really mediocre experience and this branch is extremely lacklustre when compared to the cacao 70 downtown on st cath
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,hXfyNff-F8Id7wOrA_kNAQ,99jnArFsdUhQIPNt8_lDGQ,2,All around pretty average and overpriced for what you get..Service was terrible..Wouldn't recommend for breakfast
ceHQCsqHjUU8YsLeAvAwOg,OWjcc1CL39J-ICexjyOYOw,K1ids8rmN_1JxSLhQZ_CZw,3,A good place to hang out with family and/or friends. There were  a lot of seating area to choose from when we got there which is around 9pm on a Sunday night. We ordered the chocolate fondue; one being matcha white chocolate which I really liked and the other is a dark and white chocolate split. Nothing too special about the menu; just something to fulfill your sweet tooth.
CiUQYLip2TvN9IcmLUM_mw,nzbj3PUYlERVRn7C1FNBow,w_9UeJc6HRzJKaTH8Rrdmw,3,I went there for a dinner and I think it was okay for buffet. The price is reasonable. I think in terms of quality and the price it is good.
CiUQYLip2TvN9IcmLUM_mw,XZfv70IsujPrIMGKeL9kdw,F9mf6tBoo0G4a1kvU-0wvg,2,J'ai été vraiment déçue par la piètre qualité de la nourriture; surtout pour le prix qu'on a payé (4$ pour un petit plat de riz! chaque personne!). J'ai pris le Aloo Gobi et ce n'était pas très bon; pas particulièrement savoureux. Mon amie par contre; elle a aimé son plat. En tout cas; je ne reviendrai jamais ici .
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,QsvBG-qbQ-jgXSfVp8R5SQ,yEjCem6ttclMjoDW8KFdSg,2,we went there once for drinks and it took about 10 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us when it wasn't even crowded. after that things were ok; even if the wine was well over priced. we went back because we were shopping and starving and were treated to one of the worst burgers i have ever had. grey; frozen; stuffed with fillers; i have to say it was nearly inedible. i realize this is a chain; but to me there is no excuse for not serving fresh meat; it takes all of about 4 seconds to mold a hamburger. the fries were over cooked and the salad i ordered came with a mystery dressing i did not request. the waiter we had on that day was what i could generously describe as inattentive; forgot to bring me the drink i ordered and never checked in with us again; skip this place; there is a nice pizzaria down the street.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,R5QoQC65G5JI8G5eZxJoww,EfZmi9CkxbYvG3hMIBprGw,3,We went there with my husband. .The girl in the enter was nice and helpful; the guy who made the orders was kind; too..We were drinking the month of the beer and a beer cocktail (something Russian...). They were good..After we got the foods. My quesadilla was ok; but my hubby was really upset because of his burger. .It was les 3 brasseurs burger. He said it was pretty average; nothing special; the burger that you can eat at every corner. .I think we're coming back and try another dishes; but now I can give you just 3*.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,aRrGBi6wbmx-VphFWrTOfg,6jjT8SewfIYF6SMojSzUxw,5,We came here to watch the World Cup game with a party of 7; including 3 young children. Staff was very accommodating and attentive even with the big crowd in the restaurant for the final World Cup match. We had plenty of beer (all very good); a couple of the delicious pizzas and 3 kids meals (all came with dessert!). Overall a great experience for us. The upstairs is nice and big; very open.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,KdZlltBnpXERUb6vxEdYKg,zlSMLVdBTZQcusXE9Cv1tg,1,Horrible service from the waitresses. They hesitate to give you a table when so many are visibly available. The food prices are going up while portion sizes shrink. Last time I ever go to this location.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,GpV7fg9-iadPX5HI5Qh89Q,mP1RTgyxACfMNWpAciIQbQ,3,Visited this brewpub in two locations while vacationing in Montreal...The beer here is quite decent and we ended up trying all 4 of those which they brew (1 liter each) across both visits. They could definitely have a bigger selection of beer and include at least one dark beer. When buying the beer by the liter the price is decent; otherwise its a little on the pricey side...With regards to food; we only had the pizza (2 veggie varieties) and enjoyed it both times. Somewhat small/thin but great to share with 2 people when you are not very hungry. Found the food a little on the expensive side. However; if you are still hungry they have peanuts you can munch on for free. Not quite as good as the peanuts at a 'Five Guys' (US Burger Chain); however decent. I prefer them roasted a little longer with some salt; they were just plainly roasted...Location wise; you have Brutopia just a few blocks away and other stores within vicinity. Found the location in Old Montreal by the port to be a much better location with outdoor seating even...In summary; this is an average brewpub but definitely worth the trip if you go to the one in Old Montreal. Suggest walking around a bit and then stopping in the soak up the atmosphere (be sure to be outside).
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,hJ5ESTUlFmiRp3tjr0c2-A,Mz7RkZD-XoQaI19RjogdpQ,4,Love this place! It has improved a lot over the months. For a chain; I like it a lot. The beers are cheap. 36 oz for $9.25. Yes; please. I love the mussels; too. Always returning for more

dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,Xx5fGlhBcYNO02VKv_qJ2Q,XCLxbQ-k-eSsD7pApw2Q4Q,2,Food was decent; but the service lousy. We actually had to get up and get our own utensils after asking three people (none of whom were our server; who was nowhere to be found). I'll be cautious about going back unless I have plenty of time and a high tolerance for customer abuse.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,bVEQOCwSOlaCNIBHWRPfHA,uIiFLgGW1ism8Gfx8u0yAQ,5,It is pub food but more reliable since we know we will get decent beer and fromm ( thin crust pizza).  I know sometimes walking around and with a group you want something that's not too expensive and also good decent pub food; this is the place. The beer selection is awesome and the food is above average bar food.  It is a great place for family with kids who are tire and hungry or a quick lunch bite.  I like this place for this reason

Even drink-accompanying nosh is best ordered elsewhere

We visited this locale twice since it was in walking distance of our hotel. ..First things first; the beer here...delicious. They brew it themselves and have a couple of flavors to choose from. Both times; I went with the Blanche; which has a hint of fruit in it and it was delicious. For the better bang for your buck; get the liter. It's massive and quite heavy; but worth it for less than $10! ..We also had various plates here for lunch one day. We tried their burgers; flat pizza; poutine and pasta. Everyone seemed quite satisfied and to top it off; we had great service when we were there both times.
SBnpT6JDbah-5l_52GM5sw,cstc2D1TmJQ9m8f8wZJBFg,nhWl46lWg3g3nvGaNPLgJQ,2.0,Went for brunch today and food was utter disappointment. My smoked salmon sandwich was destroyed by thick layer of mustard. Any cook should know that mustard can easily overpower any dish and who puts mustard on smoked salmon? Overall everything including bread was just dripping with some grease or oil. Huge bush of greens was also dripping with some oily dressing. Low quality food.
5QQrP0RQfq1HUqSiCM7Mmw,52t23q47TwWIexL3X4lPiQ,DJri57B_WDSxfYKGS5PSYQ,5.0,My late husband and I happened to park outside Scrollio Ice Cream last year. I believed it just recently opened. They had a girl standing outside giving out samples. Husband asked if I wanted to try one. I said sure. The sample was delicious. So i went in and bought something with pineapple and his was strawberry with marshmallow fluff. I loved it. The price is a bit steep. But worth the price..The girl did take long to prepare the ice cream and add the toppings. She seemed a bit confused and the other girl too didn't seem like she was sure what she was doing. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they had just opened. And they were still getting their bearings. .The owner was very friendly and talkative. He walked around checking things and we got a free drink as well. .But it was interesting to watch how they prepared the ice cream on that cold stone. .I haven't had a chance to stop in a try a different flavor. But I will this year. I recommend Scrollio Ice Cream. Be prepared for the price but relax and enjoy the rolled ice cream.

The food is always good and the service is beyond words!  Victor is a SUPERSTAR and Oscar and Jaimie are exceptional.  This place has that old Vegas feel which nothing on the strip can top.  Could you find more innovative food in town?  Perhaps; but nothing will compare to the overall service and atmosphere of Hugo's.  I am just lucky that I live here now and can go more than once a year.

vuNwIrd6Dx1AK6VxS43r0g,BfnYXZEfWNdmW9VbWVeg7Q,MLF5P1Z845ZIuFJZ_Rclbg,2.0,Okay; the family and I were driving south on Macleod Trail last Friday and were looking for a place to eat. I was in the mood for Chinese; or Vietnamese. I was quickly shot down; and told how unhealthy those choices were. Okay so we passed Ginger Beef; Rice for King; Kinjo's. I know Kinjo's is Japanese; but we had Japanese last week. My kids see Macdonald's; and say why don't we eat there. They always want to eat there. I said no way; lets pick something a little healthier. .Then we get to the traffic lights approaching Southland Dr. I see Jack Astor's. Hey; what about Jack Astor's ? my kids start to laugh because I say the word ass. We haven't been since this place was Fuddruckers..I have to say the inside has changed quite a bit; since I last stepped foot into this place.We were greeted by three hostesses; then quickly seated to a booth on the back of the restaurant. I proceeded to look at the menu; and thought to myself am I getting old or what ? I can hardly make out the print on the menu. It was so dark; I could hardly make out the print. Two waitresses then came to our table and introduced themselves and wrote their names on the throw away paper lining the table. Like Montana's; the one girl's name was KT. .Since I was in the mood for some Chinese; I saw on the menu a spicy chicken dish that was accompanied with fresh veggies and steamed rice..I know; I know; should've known better then to order a Chinese dish at a western styled restaurant; that was more burger and salad like..The chicken; was these little cubes of chicken (like the kind you buy frozen at Co-op.) spicy; and the rice was soggy in the middle and dry around the edges. I think I got the bottom of the rice cooker. The veggies on the other hand were okay. The other items ordered was a burger; that was okay (nothing special) and  yam fries and a salad. I also have to mention that my dinner was like $17.00..I thought that was a lot for something that didn't even taste as good as a Swansons frozen T.V. dinner..I won't be back for a LONG TIME !.When I do; I'll order something different..In closing; I would like to add that I was surprised at the amount of families eating here.

Very disappointing; won't go back.  Back to Flower Child and True Foods for the healthy eating.
a09UyTP6KoaARapiMU7oJw,JGtxPE3n3_nMLM1g-uCx0Q,qzwGJIU1jgeFXw4A27sWmA,5.0,This is a nice spot. So far tried the spicy chicken; bento; and mochiko chicken. It was all really good.  Hawaiian BBQ tends to have the same menu no matter where you go but up in this area of centennial that continues to grow; this is a nice place. Haven't gone to LnL; Lulu's; or pineapple Express/touch of aloha since this place opened. Only if I can find a place with good pork hash life will be good.  Will definitely be back.

KaO8WM7MIv2c7vaOOXlVJQ,aeELJ_VPa0JYqekZhzLEBA,tfYut0QTDiXSIwAW8bBCZA,2.0,Americana have really slipped as of late. We have been eating here for years; but the last several times have been mediocre at best. Tonight I ordered A Philly cheese steak one of my favorite items here; there was barely any meat on it what was is clumped all at the bottom of the roll which was like eating a large crouton dry and hard. My french fries were so undercooked they were floppy greasy mess. The waitress did bring me fresh fries and there were cooked properly. She did; however forget my dad's salad when she brought everyone's to the table he had to wait a while before he got his. We used to go a few times a month now we only go once every few months I don't know what happened but I hope it gets better soon!

There is nothing memorable about any of their dishes. I don't hate it- we just end up going here when we feel like settling.

It had meat within; and roasted with tomato sauce. I also like the pork confit; which came with bread; pickled jalapeños and a special mustard.

I had called the Embassy Suites and they referred me to the Rocky River Grille.  I am so glad that they did.  We worked with Nikki Jackson; who was just wonderful.  She met with us on short notice (I was only in town for one weekend) and went out of her way to accommodate my daughter's wedding wishes.  The room looked beautiful and the food was delicious.  Almost all of our guests ordered the Delmonico Ribeye and raved that it was the best steak they have ever had.  I agree.  We couldn't have been happier.  The whole experience was great.  Stress-free planning; a reception that was more than we'd hoped for; delicious food; and wonderful servers and bar tenders (Matt was the best bar tender we've ever encountered anywhere).   Thank you Nikki; Matt; and all of the staff at the Rocky River Grille!

We had friends in town and decided to visit as we were close to this location.  We normally visit the Tempe location which I would rate 5 Stars.  This location on the other hand is rated only 2 stars as the service on both occasions was below par. On this visit we decided to sit in the bar area as the dining room was busy.  The staff was friendly; but after waiting over 1 1/2 hours to get our meal I felt as if we were forgotten.  Tables around us were served but we sat with little notice.  I am sure that the server forgot to turn in our order. NO help from the management; I will rate this POOR.  The food was good; just very POOR service.  I was informed by a floor manager that the GM would contact me; never heard anything from he/she.  I had a similar issues on a previous visit but only decided to visit this location as we were close by.  Will not make the same mistake again...

She Was really rude and walked away while we were ordering. We got our food; it's good but our waitress hardly every came by to check up on us. My friend waited 10minutes for a refill; then my other friend waited another 10min on top of that! She made it very clear that she didn't care. Then when we received our check; she circled in bold TIP 15%. I mean we believe if you received awesome service; then yeah u deserve that and maybe more; but knowing you gave us bad service and then expecting that; hahaha think again NOPE! ..The food and ambiance is good; HOWEVER the service SUCKS! Because of this experience we won't be going back; NEVER AGAIN. And I'll make sure my friends know about this as well. And btw they got a 1star because of the food.

But whenever I go; it's packed and the way the tables are set up; it's crowded enough as it is. On top of that I feel like I wait way too long for food. I'd come more often because it's close to where I live but just for those two reasons alone; I end up going elsewhere. And I like flavored creamer in my coffee because I don't need to add sugar since the flavored creamers are already sweet but they only have plain here which forces me to add sugar. I actually walked out today. I waited 20 minutes and still no food. I noticed the people who got there AFTER I did; got their food before me. I don't think I'll be back.

Service was great and the restaurant is very accommodating  when it comes to making changes to your order. For example; you want fettucine noodles instead of linguine? No problem? You can't decide between two pastas? You can get both and change the sauces. ..My favourite bites - crab dip; fettucine with garlic; and the veal was tasty. The reason for not giving more stars was the ravioli was hard and flavourless and I didn't like the watery sauce. The trio of stuffed pasta appetizer was also a pass. I found out that the spaghetti; linguine and fettucine are homemade; but the rest of the pastas are not. ..For the price; I can see why this is a popular spot. If you order the right thing; the food is very tasty. Best time to go is Sunday; Monday and Tuesday for $9 pasta.

I told them I am gluten free. She also asked if it was a special occasion and I said we had a birthday. She asked if they could do a candle on the dessert and I said yes. When we arrived it was like we had never spoken. They did not know about my diet restrictions or offer any input and did not remember the birthday. . It wasn't a big deal; as I know what I can and can't eat; I just don't know why they waste time calling and asking. I thought it was an amazing gesture but it turned out to be disappointing...Upon arrival we were seated promptly and given menus. They have a star system so our waiter explained that 1 star is a small portion and 2 is medium; 3 is a large shareable portion. We ordered seared scallops which had 3 stars and filet which was also a 3. The beef was enough for 2 but we got 3 Scallops total for the other entree. Three scallops is hardly a shareable portion. We had to send the filet back as it was overcooked and it took a bit before it came back out. The food was delicious but skimpy. They are out of a LOT of wine and didnt have what we wanted. They substituted with a comparable bottle which was sub par and over priced as I can buy the same wine online for $13.99 and we were charged $40 for it. .That being said...our waiter was nice although he got over seated toward the end of our meal and forgot a bunch of things which we had to ask for several times. ..Too bad that it's so overpriced and understaffed because the food was pretty amazing. ..I don't think we will be going back.
SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ,7T29nKq9be9jnpPuB5XHKw,5t2iq39N9it8oh5S2p3toA,4.0,great atmosphere - the appetizer; salad and wifes trout were excellent. My rack of lamb which was recommended was just average.  .The waitress was attentive when around but appetizer plates with empty shells sat through most of dinner; salad plates when empty left till entree arrived..For the price ot the restaurant those kind of items do make a difference..We will be back because we like the overall experience; but details need to be picked up.
5h7ra0kJKswSZEzbFSIpaw,GMeYzbl_kvY0dGZeA4Lfvw,qU5MufQsHp5wnsXtj9UgTQ,3.0,Nice little spot.  Not a huge coffee person; but the drinks were good enough.. we came in during off hours and the place is nice and charming.  A few people were there working and casual chatting took place.  A very nice barista gave us tips on some places to check out while we're in town.
mlkVAm2DkGnKnNVR1AnQLA,fuux76suMAhWIpwQdNqIWg,Uf4J0NH1-JRChzGrCr6N7Q,3.0,I stop on for gas and the occasional Rockstar. Staff is not friendly in an eerie sort of way.  But I work in the building behind it and it's convenient so just try my best to get in and out. Otherwise very clean and well stocked. Except needs better wine selection.
MwFHjf0yALSL6WZc8d2mUw,JnPIjvC0cmooNDfsa9BmXg,-Uq5SD5UgHXhIIZLgReubQ,5.0,This is pretty much my new local...I've come here almost a dozen times in the past few months and it's consistently been a solid good time. The decor and mood are sexy; vintage/preloved and old-timey; with those plush velvet couches that have button dimpling accents and regal armrests. There are chandeliers and soft candle lighting at the tables. ..The seating is ample; with proper tables; coffee tables and seats at the bar; so take your pick; although the regular crew of regulars may have beat you to the prime spots surrounding the bar...Every time I've come here the vibe has been welcoming and unpretentious. You get the feeling that people here appreciate a quiet; relaxed; non-douchey atmosphere with really great music unobtrusively playing in the background. I've heard Massive Attack; Portishead; Beck and lots of other favourites here...One of the guys working the bar is a dead ringer for Jeremy Sisto (Billy from Six Feet Under: http://www.notas.com/Jeremy%20Sisto%20med.jpg); but was decked out like a member of Run-D.M.C.; no joke. I dig. Last night when I stopped by; another bartender (Joe) happily charged my iPhone behind the bar while I sipped on my tumbler of Pinot Grigio. I can't say this kind of generosity is a common occurrence at other bars...They have DJs on some nights and I also learned last night that they do karaoke (Sundays!). And have a full menu for finger type bar foods like potato skins; chicken wings (ahem: a visit from wing aficionado Sarah L is required!!); hummus and chips and sweet potato fries...See you soon (tonight??)!
9-cVW8wSRoE6Nmnc7v0uUA,nRYoDygUVhyipUsDKmQTbA,3uYSqAgz1I1TgOAENY0LAA,4.0,Great new age food. The service is so-so; it took a few minutes for one hostess to acknowledge us and another told us that they didn't have straws after we ordered waters and a soda. We ordered cocktails that came with straws in them. Our waiter however was very attentive and interacted with our 6 year old. We ordered a mojito; white sangria; the pork belly sliders; corned beef hash; and chocolate chip pancakes. The drinks were beautiful and tasty; and the food was delicious and filling.
SzlzAjBwFcdbOwRPjNxaxw,UAQkLAF8D-cHZizSZin0Nw,_vMhNkFARhvoJv0NNogwPg,1.0,Walked in on a Friday night with a booking for 3. Waited almost 45 minutes before they told us your table is ready because they overbook the place. The wife of the owner comes and tells us table for 3? I was like yes; she was like where is the 3rd person? I was like hes coming.I felt she wanted to keep us waiting for the 3rd person cause she didnt want to lose a table cause she overbooked the place .We sat there and ordered and the 3rd person came and he asked a question on the menu that we already asked before; the waiter said ask your friends; I already explained this.Really?!! We get the Paella and some other plate; and found hair in my food; but I didnt tell my wife cause I knew she would walk out and it will ruin all our night; even if they changed the dishes.The Paella wasnt good anyway; and I think honestly if you knew anything about paella; you wouldnt come to this place.Finally; we order the check and pay; and literally 5 minutes before we left.The wife of the owner; the manager comes and tell us; hey you guys want to move to the bar?I can order you something there; because I have a party of 16 who have been waiting for an hour.First of all shes lying; cause we ordered and ate and paid in almost 45 minutes; and there wasnt a party of 16 waiting.Secondly; for the first time in my life I see a manager asking a customer to get up from their table that they reserved and ask us to sit on the bar.In addition to that my wife is pregnant so it would be even harder for her.The owner of the place should teach his rude wife how to run a business and treat customers right.Worst place and customer service ever!
-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA,5-ni6jRdBKI4I6ZVMpMIxQ,AqPT3GygbLSrSi3QjlbgMg,4.0,This was my third visit to this establishment...always a pleasant experience. This day; unlike the other two visits where I ordered a salad;  I ordered the Samburger (medium well) with blue cheese.  Oh my goodness!!!  That burger was soooo good it made my toes curl. Generally; I'm not a beef eater; but every once in a while I crave a burger. Today was that day. I could not have chosen a better spot. I went around 4ish; it wasn't busy; so I got a lot of attention from the bar staff. :-) ..I like the indoor/outdoor bar. There is outside seating as well...All of the staff was great. The facility was clean; and very trendy. ..Four stars because I asked for no 1000 Island on my burger; but mustard and ketchup instead. The burger came with blue cheese; the bacon; burger; and the bun. I didn't complain; simply asked for ketchup and mustard and I added it to the burger. I will be back! :-)
u1RQFcA4Br_peVRh_WBOsQ,ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,lTjduVLrPe_b2OsDgRSMdw,4.0,I heard about this new brick and mortar restaurant on a news segment from our local FOX 5;    It wasn't on a restaurant review; but was on who helped her grandfather build this place the past few month.    The story of Jade Morris; the ten year old girl who allegedly murdered by the Bellagio knife attacker; was that little girl..I'm not going any further on that story; but I'll ended it like this...I hope Brenda Stoke burns in hell for what she did    ..One good thing came from this;  I found a place in Vegas that make Cincinnati Chili; and does it very well!      ..After a pretty good workout at Golds on Eastern;  my friend an I decided to checkout this place among the 100's of other eateries in this part of Vegas; and since it was a stone throw away from the Gym it was a no brainier to walk down this strip center to Top notch.    ..Service was great; and we were greeted very quickly by our host.     The menu is kind of small; but it was straight forward; and I was craving chili.    If you look at our picture of this place; you'll see what we ate.    It was very good; and the chili wasn't overly sweet; and had a mild spiciness to it.    I really enjoyed the hot link; and it had a nice snap to when I bit into it.    My friend doesn't eat too well after the gym; and I had some of her fries...wow.   It was very good!; and had that double fry action.    I almost ate most of it; but backed off.....hey; I have my news years resolution to keep..Top Notch shares space with a bar; but that establishment has it's own entrance; so it safe to say this place is children friendly.   ..Finally; I will give this place a  four out of five; because of the chili; and service.    Good luck to you folk; and everyone might want to give them a try.
MfmBd9C7tUfOkGu2eJpK2w,m0h1K2mjXYsG-Pjhjx2zjg,baC7apOH1D2aW0CA3gZjTQ,5.0,I was told about this place from a friend and decided to give it a try. I was impressed with the food; customer service and atmosphere at this location.  Since that time I have returned with others and they were also impressed with   the overall visit. Needess to say I will be returning and it will be today.
6Zogn4PXnK-ODBiRy5iz7Q,CV75PpOtxZ40YbL1YE7jAQ,2nktjdObsWFZ62QR7ZQ7Eg,5.0,I decided to go in after a workout prior to my nail appointment for a little treat at 8:55am! .I tried one of the regular glazed donuts and it was absolutely delicious! Fresh and not too sweet! .I also got a coffee but they ran out midway so the amazing lady who was helping me asked if I had a few minutes to wait for another coffee to be brewed.. Unfortunately I had a nail appointment  at 9am so I had to go but what she did next was what above and beyond! She personally delivered a fresh cup of coffee with macaroons that are to die for! Being in customer service myself it just means so much when someone goes above and beyond to make thief customers happy! I am truly pleased with this bakery and will definitely be going back at least twice a month for my sweets!! Also I can't wait to try thief croissants- they smelled amazing!!

Thank you for someone pricing good services bc I am here at least once a week bc my little one takes dance at the studio in the same plaza.  So I can have my yogurt/ sweet while I wait..The toppings are like other yogurt places nothing out of the ordinary or anything that separates them from.Their competitors. .I come Bc of the convenience.
CEsh0ScOKlL3mpvjypqszA,IzuP-7SD1qGatQm__nbnWQ,5v-g52si2fzcek8VSVujSA,1.0,My wife and I were in Montreal for a week.  We were here on a Friday night; and we knew it would be busier.  Well; when we arrived; there was a group of 4 in front of us.  But I noticed a place for 2 at the bar.  Without an attendant or host; we went to sit at the bar thinking it was open seating.  We sat there for a few minutes until someone said we couldn't sit there and had to wait in line.  Well; we went back in line.  After 15 minutes; the group of four was seated.  Then; once they were seated; we took the same two seats at the bar.  I feel like this was unusual; but maybe it was a Montreal-type quirk...We ordered a pair of beers and some food.  The food itself was okay.  It was smaller portion than what I expected considering the price...I wouldn't recommend this place; especially if you have had Izakaya somewhere else.  This is really is not an Izakaya in my mind.
TQxMhEar6--Wj4Du8nRQsw,DSakdjejUJY9sn3eaUyezw,bT7urcyalT--SLM9ZpWFCw,1.0,Went here to pick up my takeout. Restaurant wasn't the cleanest looking inside. The food was meh and it left me and the old lady feeling ill for the rest of the night. Must have been some bad meat or something. ..Stay away!

Chicken soup is heavenly and so comforting; like my Romanian grandma's... Staff is nice and polite; waitresses are sweet and friendly. So happy this place exists.
bsrj9_hFAql3dlSf244zpg,7F9gNmQKGEZZ891uAZ4IDw,GlGaf7uEXU6Tit9Ab2mhOA,5.0,My wife and I loved the Trump Hotel. We didn't want to leave. We've visited Las Vegas 39 times so we've stayed in many of the hotels. We upgraded to a large corner suite on the 47th floor. We thought we would miss having a casino. However; we didn't. It was nice to be in a non-smoking building away from the casino. We enjoyed the pool and tried the restaruant. They were both nice. The location was across the street from the mall and down the street from the Wynn. We spent sometime in both. We'll definately stay at the Trump Hotel again.
2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ,fSrjS8zHddeFGcuTp0a3Hw,SxrWkcJb7soTS3mmM9j2Kg,3.0,After every trip to vegas; i tell myself no more buffet! But i still haven't learned.  The selection here wasn't as good as i remember. I wouldn't pay how ever much it was for the just okay food.  I only went because i had a free voucher on my red card from playing the slots.  My friends and i came for lunch on a monday so there was no wait.  We paid the lunch price and because it was already 3:00pm; it rolled over to dinner service. (not so secret buffet trick that i'm sure many have used).  My friends like to sit for hours and try everything.  My favorite part is always dessert. I love the tiny little cakes and trying a scoop of every gelato flavor.  I probably wouldn't come back unless i won another free buffet or my friends were very insistent.  I only do buffets under certain circumstances. Otherwise; the food in general in most buffets aren't worth the price. NO MORE BUFFETS!  I'm getting old and my stomach is getting weak.

-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg,kxz6Q2AERQeo9x6nnbHZNg,zjqQatZ4ZevfYY5V3kfiyA,4.0,I had very low expectations for this restaurant coming in solely because of the name of the restaurant. Then I learned from Yelp that it was a thai restaurant and thought; oh that was misleading. So remember guys; never judge a restaurant by its name. And always check them out on Yelp beforehand; in case there are secret menu items...On my first visit I had to try the secret menu item that everyone raves about: the Islamic noodles. Not sure why it's called Islamic; but I vaguely remember reading that the ingredients may be halal. Do not rely on this though; please check with server. But lets get back to those noodles. Extremely fragrant coconut milk taste in the smooth nutty sauce with a hint of spice. Portions were also huge. Not sure if it's worth the $11 though. A slightly cheaper alternative would be the siam noodles. The sauce tastes very similar just minus the coconut and a very chunky peanut. Also if you have a serious nut allergy I would try to avoid this place. ..They also have a points card! 10 meals and you get a free meal =)..If you have a small appetite I would recommend you split an appetizer and main with a friend instead of getting 2 separate mains. Unless you want to save it for your next meal. Cause you can do that too.

We were greeted by a friendly staff; and the waitress was very pleasant. We ordered crab cake eggs Benedict and other typical breakfast dishes. We all thought the food was delicious. Highly recommended if you have not tried this place yet!

ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ,m1hh7pNYO7qMJcueiBwD_w,vzZxHIaNVaPY0IrwPxK5Ag,4.0,Went last night for dinner and the main draw for us are the lettuce wraps.  We had to wait for a table...not an issue; but while waiting in the bar; we observed one of the bartenders (woman) do something that was very disgusting.  She had made a reddish colored drink and placed it on the bar for pickup by a server.  As she placed the drink on the bar; she reached over; took a straw and put it into the drink...while using her finger to draw some of the drink up into the straw and then she sucked what had been drawn up into the straw and threw the straw away; all while admitting that it was pretty good.  Sorry young lady...not acceptable; especially in front of customers.  The gentleman sitting at the bar right near this occurance actually looked at her and she made some comment to him (couldn't hear exactly what she said).  ..Needless to say; the lettuce wraps were wonderful (as we've come to except)!

9BohUwW-fTfcpiBT782Fkg,cTUIAR6lZDp91McnHz8RKw,LnuA3x5Yfzkmvr5nJzG09g,4.0,Which Wich is a chain I heard some good things about; so it intrigued me to find out they were opening a downtown Madison location! I went in to grab a quick lunch to go; and before I could even attempt to check in on Yelp (I couldn't either because it didn't have a page yet =/); I was happily greeted by an employee asking if i've ever been to a Which Wich before. I said no; and he gave me an overview of their ordering process. It was thoughtful of them to have an employee just to make sure people knew what they were doing at least during their first week of business! It certainly helped too; because Which Wich does things differently. There; you pick up a bag; and fill in a bunch of bubbles to describe what sub you'd like; including the toppings; sauces; the temperature of the sandwich; and size of sandwich. Then; you just give it to the cashier; and then they charge you. It's different; but I bet this system works better for the employees in the end; so I think it's fine...The sandwiches charge a flat rate for the most part: A small is $5.50; a medium is $8.25 and a large is $11.00 (I think). So; you'll notice that it's a bit pricier than say; Jimmy Johns or Subway up the road; but I think you're getting what you pay for here. I had a medium black bean patty sub with a ton of sauces and random veggies on it; and I can say that: I liked it a fair amount; it was filling; I didn't feel ripped off; and I didn't feel garbage after eating it. Given that I had no idea what I was doing the first time; I certainly could make a better sub the next time I go; without too many unnecessary things. One good thing about Which Wich is that you feel like you have more control over your sandwich than you do at the other sub places. It's easy to make your food vegetarian; vegan; gluten free; healthy; unhealthy (or Epic; as some people call it); carnivore (They're known for a sub that has 5 different meats and 3 cheeses); etc. etc...Overall; I could see myself frequenting Which Wich on State occasionally. It's much better than any other sub place in the vicinity; and it even can hold a candle to some of State's other good lunch spots.

We ordered the Family Special: a large cheese pizza(we added pepperoni and jalapeños); garlic knots with homemade marinara and more than enough chicken wings with homemade ranch that we are bringing some home. Plus we added a Caesar salad with homemade dressing and of course.....Phyllis's meatballs! A family owned business that greets you with huge smiles when you walk through the door; I couldn't ask for more but of course they go above and beyond with a dessert plate that satisfies my birthday sweet tooth! Thank Above the Crust for an awesome birthday dinner! I'll be back sooner than later!
_giuQJ5eYQNxE_wtcNDm_A,HhYUDP1vR7CSRi2cvfai0Q,rTJ5CquksgSYcyhaTHvCqw,3.0,I'm not an authority on Latin American food but it seems rather authentic to me. The staff is nice and they do have a few who can speak English. The menu has English translations which is also very helpful!!  We got the chicken flautas; chicken in a jalepeno cream sauce and the carna asada. The flautas were okay but you could really taste the lard in the tortillas. The Carna Asada was a little over cooked for sure but had a great taste. The chicken was delicious and was very spicy but yummy!! Neither of us were a fan of the tortillas that came with any of the dishes. We just could really taste the lard that they used which is not something either of us is used to. Over all though it's a decent little spot to check out and they are open late.

I never slept well in hotels; but their beds were very comfortable and allowed me to sleep! Great price and in walking distance of everything.  ..I would recommend staying here over the MGM. Especially if your using MLife. Their buffet here is also better than others. ..We will definitely be staying here again!! :)

RVNxhRf8ERTAb38vBWvCig,-0jQI-Ru2BAJsGsGcFglPw,LYLO0ZjoFfnmyMyoZl2ABA,2.0,Bleh...The epitome of icky airport food...  I've been to Ruby's many a time back in SoCal. I figured of my choices at the D gate; Ruby's was my best shot at cheap but decent. Wrong!... I ordered a grilled cheese w/ tomato.... They forgot the tomato :( The bread was cold and soggy and didn't seem very grilled. I also ordered fried zucchini which were good but DAMN... cool those things off before you serve them. I annihilated my mouth with one of those... They were way to hot. My opinion on this place is: Walk on By. Pay exorbitant prices for crummy food somewhere else...

She is absolutely fantastic and made the already incredible meal so much better. Her recommendations were spot on (not the oh it depends on what you want... type thing; she is ACTUALLY helpful); she was so nice and personable; and she was incredibly attentive to every detail. The food was delicious as well. I got the burger and the fries with garlic aioli; and I could have licked the plate afterward if we weren't in public. The manager; Matej; is also amazing and extremely attentive. If you're on the fence; do yourself a favor and come here. Food; ambiance; service are all top notch...Thank you for making our brunch (and my husband's 30th birthday meal) so perfect.

This place is small and quick to grab a little snack. By little snack I am not kidding. The food here is tiny! I absolutely loved the fish burger it is a must when you're here! Please; make sure to request the tartar sauce. I also; ordered a the special White Castle burgers and they were okay. You may have to order a few because; there small. I had the cheesecake and it was tiny and okay. You're better off getting dessert elsewhere. The cheese sticks were amazing! These are a must when you come to eat here. Overall; the place is clean but; there is NO sense of urgency. They all look real brand new working here and the customer service is something can work on! ..Until; next time Vegas...

The veggies seemed fresh and the food was flavorful. The food is also affordable and the menu has a lot of options from which to choose.

8ysapimCImBSDKl28qIrjA,68IfMTHZH8bXp9JQYz_QMg,8joOd-SO8RokSP-5u7ynQA,1.0,Ahh.. That was gross. I feel like vomiting just remembering our experience there. I don't eat beef so we ordered flautas; burritos and tacos (all chicken). It was the same mixture of gross; bland chicken in all three items. The chicken looks horrible; has a disgusting texture and lacks in flavor..Also; the place is filthy like another reviewer mentioned. I didn't dare to go the bathroom but there was paper on the floor under every single table.The health department needs to shut them down!
vyEetoXzGq9vBTWpOu85pQ,GpULAQqNdCCpZG0Ly6-5gA,gL7ek3gaAdYnph8OfZ4i-w,2.0,maybe we ordered the wrong things.... 12 boneless; nachos & a black & blue burger.  burger was ok. boneless chicken was like the frozen stuff you buy out of the grocery stores; bleh! and my nachos would have been ok if it was prepared as I asked!  it was a to go order so I asked them to separate the wet toppings on the side for me so I could put it on when we got home so it wasn't mushy... we had mushy nachos. gross.  the were generous w/ the military discount tho I'm not sure we'll be back.
WDYE-OCXNgKyXGNuBjMgEw,dEp7BNFhnjaMYWcJ_KqsyQ,ZirfNq-fUVagkbupknJElw,5.0,This is such a cute little hidden gem. Very romantic inside. The food was very delicious and the service was excellent! One of the things I love about Vegas;... any night can be a special & romantic date night! Such a beautiful restaurant... I didn't expect it to be so delicious! We ordered the special of the night; the ribeye steaks; they came with the most delicious cognac peppercorn sauce! For appetizers; the shishito peppers & fried artichokes as an appetizer. Those are both very difficult appetizers to find! define. And; they just happened to be my favorites! And; for dessert I said I wanted the lemon tart or crème brûlée. But; when I got back from the restroom... it turns out he ordered both of them! And; a 2nd lemon drop martini! Oh my! Definitely give this place a try! I was extremely impressed!
4SnS6705jmVnZO6mbFmpWw,_uAUi5BfDaNRw7pTJCANfA,cTrkY9nN-l5alxGR_KS_CA,2.0,My first 2-3 visits I was excited about finding a good soul food spot. But my last 2 visits helped me to decide not to go back. When I made my selections I had to wait on a fresh batch of chicken wings which was ok; but a lady came to the front from the kitchen yelling back into the kitchen using profane language in front of all of the customers in the lobby all loud(it went on for about 1-2 minutes) about the dropping(into the fryer) of the specific type of chicken and how she was about to leave. Then once I finally thought my order was ready it was someone else's bc they gave my plate away.  Then after telling them what I had on my plate 3 more times for reassurance they still fixed my plate wrong. So I've had my share of Floyd's; I'm good until I find another soul food spot.
OSAM8aT1-BqW_ctoN7XBtQ,0yoEamq-KuxfrYfTNe95BA,1-7DTyUdr4v07bOAG55PLA,5.0,Love it ! Great experience ! Employees friendly; helpful got some groceries; fountain drink also am getting gas here. You guys really knock it out of the Park! Keep it up!
CzcfYhCbzPoVEgVZfOgw8A,EyjCu2OIaEVC1gEnpdJSbQ,-H2MrCOLazHGTAmht0F89g,1.0,Service is terrible. Has so much promise with location and style of food but can't get over the terrible service. Whether it is waiting a long time or not getting orders right there is no reason for being this bad. Almost as if they are trying to be bad. ..Called for a pick up order for 20 minutes. Because I had been here before and knew the service was bad asked specifically if they were sure that this was going to be ok. Went to the restaurant 20 minutes after ordering and was asked who took my order and then waited an additional 35 minutes. If you want a crab boil go to the east side. ..You don't want these crabs.
J1KCaKqw-1qcERELeTJEBA,ZLD9DGhfwh5Bp4sOUjvOEw,eUcNmYcST24s5LLTqXbfUw,5.0,Great place for breakfast! On Sunday they start serving dinner at 11am.  Always good service & food.  Just a family kind of place.
qrjRRBOUmN7MFxBQNuJZIA,D_uUJZCSVSvV-TTCQbeCQg,Up2uu4tbi-qWE_d3wcHDvA,1.0,Upon recommendation from my brother; we decided to try this place out. Out of all the food we ordered; our total bill ended up being $42.99. That's to feed a party of six. Although the prices are relative to any other fast food place you could eat at; I was not impressed with this restaurant at all.  The quality of food was not that great; some of the food was lukewarm to cold; the fries were over salty; and the flavor of the sandwiches left a lot to be desired.  Save your money visiting this place and go a few miles down the road to McDonald's or Burger King. You get the same fast food quality of food but better the flavor.
3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,Gqcl-AUOB5pfv4b2hfVDkQ,B_0rWq9Sx8w0ONPxVrncaw,5.0,This is the best breakfast place in Vegas. The portions are big; the food is great and everything I have tried is so good.

BWrdSeWCWKVQQGnJC2oyrQ,HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,EPEfhIVaAxX4RJ4grEiAQA,4.0,Rolled in as I was craving a Venti; Iced Carmel Machiado; Quad; Shaken.  The location is tight (traffic wise) but the drive-thru was fast and friendly.  When I have to be a corporate coffee lemming....This will be a location of choice when craving the previous described order.
kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w,FvivYrK-o2dp_Sk5ips8nA,5689r9XeWYe9ssxg6YYBAg,3.0,We had been here once before and had found the food rather bland so did not have very high expectations. However; was pleasantly surprised..We came in for the Sunday buffet..They had a nice variety of dishes and everything was good. The chicken tikka and tandoori chicken really stood out. Good stuff..Looking forward to come back and try the a la carte..Also; did i mention...unlimited mango lassi with the lunch buffet. :) :)
Z3JilPsbidx5KqDCTcdQWg,1c62FNZ7pFNleAQftG_C0g,gLN3c8sIWo-Awa78iWbnAA,4.0,Very good - family run.  Never had anything bad from here.  A little place - not too fancy.  I get it delivered though so that's fine.  Don't hesitate to try it though- it's legit.  5 stars reserved for fancier; fine dining Thai.
B01pO_pI_8AOfEsukGNg-Q,kANeXSvmLmXRbQYnIznc2g,fffoTBCF3i9awd91qjuKKA,5.0,Very flavourful homemade Korean food; friendly owners as well. Great portions for the price!
nm9aJr7qQadbkTP6lnXB1Q,Dv8oPvUGf9Wxz019mqLTQQ,ig11HlUrUYiYjZfpLgx6AQ,5.0,Best local bar. Everyday there is a special and Friday if u are creative you could get a free lunch. Fish is yummy. Salads are fresh. Terri is so fun. No bad days here. Like Stacy. She is a hard worker and very friendly. Consider this our place . ..Closed. Sad but true
IRbgMt0cVuzK1KSppU16_Q,r6zCA77Y1BIa-bt_FT-5fQ,7Vp-R2jr0CLwE1-RiWXl8Q,5.0,One of the sexist decors I've ever seen!! The eyes behind the bar seduce me! Oh and their sushi was delicious. Try it!!!
_eKvk2GoGKb3CoYolHgRlg,EJkxYot--rMncS2qc26Pdg,ui1ZsX2OaJZJKoFVq37iDQ,5.0,Adore this place! The pita bread and hummus are to die for! You will not be let down with this appetizer. You might just find yourself ordering more. The Greek side salad is also a favorite. Staff are nice and this place is always busy!
7bQU0QI_YID3MgZirZHmSg,vq4vh6cy48Hcg99Iy63YHg,rzqmZr0d9A3x2DtT9OFwxQ,5.0,Love the atmosphere; make sure you ask for a table by the window in advance if you want to see the falls.  Went for an anniversary dinner; the staff had a happy anniversary card and candles on the tale when we get there!   What a nice surprise!    Food is always great; and drinks are poured nicely; will definitely return!
ByFMv3p5X1aNeZhU61rDcA,fHOBGmtI1VdGKWIxrFH0kA,WxyXAiZHyIZGAkaNxN8Lrw,4.0,I actually stayed at the Strat last year in May. I love the Strat for it's colorful ambiance; and the fact that I was winning at their slots and tables (though I lost it all which was entirely my fault). I also won free tickets to the AMerican Superstars show and I enjoyed that show so much! The Michael Jackson impersonator really touched my heart. I trekked back to Stratosphere in February of this year just to see the show again. It's truly too bad that the Strat got rid of the show the past month because it brought me back everytime. ..I also enjoyed the food options. The buffet (but only for brunch) and the Roxy's Diner (but only the milkshake). There was also a Mcdonalds there that I frequented (hey; good; cheap; reliable; late-night; fast food). The Mcdonalds outside of the Strat and around the corner I also frequented because they had free Wifi (which no Vegas hotel has). There is also a Burger King and IHop near the Strat. I did not appreciate their gym very much because it was small and always packed but I did get to use a treadmill and for paying only about $25 per night; I figured I got a lot more than what I paid for...The pools are great too. The big pool is rather large with little theming. The hot tub was nice and it was a fun environment. I love the heat of the sun there! The adult pool is also nice with amazing views and nice music. I was not crazy about the tower because it was there I learned about my fear of heights but if not for that fear; that; the thrill rides; the restaurant; and clubs and lounges up there would have been ultimately enjoyable. The clubs and lounges were free for guests always so that made me happy because I at least peak at them (and they were cool) before running to the elevator to make an exit! Entry to the tower was also complimentary because we were guests...The rooms were definitely functional and pretty with nice red and white tones. It had one of the best room colors I have seen thus far in vegas. The bathroom was not extravagant but simple and nice. ..I feel that the Strat will fall off even more now that the Sahara will be closing and the AMerican Superstars show left. I mean; what will be the point to go all the way out there except for sleeping there or the thrill rides? I'm afraid I might have to say bye bye to the Strat real soon. *tear*
dqoxe7g7CsnFlRQA9N-2NQ,W790dqDNU4dlvcLptdksSw,3cSflTeEdynkgvsxwxtTDQ,4.0,This place is very unique; very large loft-like space where you can come and work or study in peace. Interesting interior with modern wooden tables and chairs. Coffee is great; I tried a latte with almond milk and it was creamy and delicious.
R3TC2oq8fQK9c9BNMZ-ynA,Zsfc3e_arKRDQuYuQ-rDRA,i6K-8Nrs-aym8Y96VMVmdw,4.0,I totally love this place.  They have an interesting selection of rolls that are actually reasonably priced! The Pacific Roll was the table's favorite; jalapenos; tuna; avocado; yum. We also really loved the Dynamite Scallop roll; lots of meat in the rolls.  I actually prefer this place to Nobu. There. I said it.
2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ,Ma_0j4B6I1eUb5fiolkzwg,XfxkmQkB935um7WoXHAwzg,1.0,First of all the decor seemed like eating at a old grandma's home. The seafood selection is pitiful there was nothing to the oysters and crab legs were overly salty! The other selections were not very appealing for the price we paid. I have been home for an hour and haven't left the bathroom.  Shame on you wynn buffet for the terrible product you put out and thanks for getting me sick! But I'm sure you really don't care what I think!
R-sEoZXf37pGzLnid7s6wA,n2I95AzSGw41ihtqL3MLtg,IcGNA_4JsPYofaz3TrCyMA,4.0,This place always have fresh; hot authentic Mexican food. You know they make it right there. And very good portions for the price! I think they should expand a little; everyone I know loves it!!
ny8YcGEViSGKWxo69xfiiA,iImnb-W4UaMsLsXd9Eq3EA,co9BK6yQrP8VNGf5ag_V-g,2.0,Saucemans what happened?? I just came in for the first time in about 6 months and did I miss something? Did you guys change owners? Change chef/cooks? Decide it's better to run a canteen? Disappointed is all I can say. I moved away and decided to call in for dinner - when I lived in south end you guys were a staple; best BBQ in charlotte as far as I was concerned - again - what happened?..I had ribs; dry; chewy; like they'd been cooked all day and left in a warmer; may as well have been jerky. BBQ sauce; all you could taste was pepper...Hush puppies; or crumbly rocks? The latter; worst I've ever tried (I couldn't eat them)..White slaw; or cabbage in pure vinegar? ..Collards; or greens in pure vinegar?..Saving grace was the potato salad which was edible but I could get that from food lion...No wonder you guys have resorted to groupon to get people in the door; something has gone wrong; maybe it was an off night; I hope so; I hope you guys do well and I hope this isn't the new norm. ..Disappointed in clt
ByFMv3p5X1aNeZhU61rDcA,rV3wHZflGHyKN64V83ZJpg,gIPNkH2T-kGhXJEhCQDOIw,2.0,Beds were okay; but the bathroom and scent killed it. Smelled lightly of smoke and liquor. The bathroom made a airplane bathroom seem large. They hand a part of the door sanded away so that you could close the door without hitting the toilet! Will not stay there again
jF3sWSqa-6TyROZgSUGrIw,NgP1fwHk6Q2Je5AVS_HEyg,xAVK995axL_dUqi7itFWgw,3.0,Came here for a friend's 40th birthday and it was actually quite a lot of fun.  Our waitress was pretty attentive; which I was happy about; especially since it was for a special occasion.  The food also came pretty quick after ordering.  We opted for the package which included a drink; appetizer; main and dessert/another drink.  All this for $35 per person which I thought was a pretty reasonable price.  Plus; the birthday celebrant got a cowgirl hat that she was able to keep :)..White Sangria - Not a big drinker especially when it comes to sangria.  I'm now thinking that what I've had before was made in a certain way that did not agree with my tastebuds.  Theirs was actually quite enjoyable as it tasted more like juice.  5/5...Cowboy Poutine - This; I thoroughly enjoyed! For an appetizer; it was actually a pretty good size.  If you have read any of my previous reviews that involved poutine; I always say that it MUST be cheese curds with delicious gravy.  Theirs was spot on.  Though I do prefer fresh cut fries when it comes to poutines; the curds and their gravy went really well with their seasoned fries.  5/5...Pete's Pickles - Tried a bit of this and it was alright.  The batter was nice but it would just fall off the pickle easily; unlike the other fried pickles I've had before.  3/5...Zac's Chicken Fried - Generous serving which also came with fries. I got pieces of white meat; with barely any skin on which is the best part.  It was also overly seasoned so with he combination of fries; the dish was way too salty for me. The mushroom gravy; however; did kill off the saltiness quite a bit but you get a small amount. Was more like a condiment size to be honest.  3/5...Black-Jack Brownie - The Jack Daniels chocolate sauce caught my eye so this last part was an easy pick.  I didn't find it too sweet; which was nice. Either it wasn't too sweet or my tastebuds was still overflowed with the saltiness from the chicken.  4/5. ..Though the food was just mediocre; the night was a lot of fun.  The servers were attentive and the food came pretty quick after ordering; even for those who showed up late to the party.  With respect to the crowd; it was a good crowd who really came to enjoy the music and line-dancing whenever they had them.  Many parties who were there early seemed like they were there for a special occasion (ie. bdays; bachelorette; etc).  Majority of the guests were females; however more males showed up a little later (probably for the prior reason; haha!). By the time we left around 1am; there was a line-up to get in so I guess the place is a happening place for many. Personally; I'm more into the R&B/Hip Hop/Reggae/Soca type scene; but the night was alright!
XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg,cKqZk06hmnX3UrEzzfFVkg,YBZMaUAMKKzF-MywqBzZdQ,4.0,Strawberry tarte was good; but for $5+ it was a really small slice. Brizh crepe with apples and ice cream was amazing. Would go back just for that. $10 and filled with lots of apple slices; butter; and delicious vanilla ice cream. Wish the scoop of ice cream was very small.
YpePlG2UW_mf-zhFaCgubA,Wz2HbUDP3jCbLmxZIRE_1g,qr-paIHea_VPqbyD5SHkqw,5.0,Great place to eat; great service and a wonderful environment. All the tapas are top quality; well thought out menu with good prices. Try the Churrasco; definitely my favorite on the menu and be sure to leave room for dessert!
h_aDhTBNXzMeVpe9DnSTVw,02ZRyKVyJO5HquOCmJ76pg,g-706JTY64Is9RxsLont9w,1.0,I stopped going to this location and will start to shop at another local grocery store. The amount of bums outside of the store and people begging for money in the parking lot is ridiculous. The store does nothing to stop this. This is not a safe environment for its customers and that is why I have decided to spend my money elsewhere.
22LyWivLY_y_b3ohASfP2Q,t9lwePmlZ7Sl_wiw9SFSrQ,qYLcIjYUdiZJtAj8JXxJEQ,5.0,The girlfriend and I went here for dinner.  I had read the reviews and I was not disappointed.  For being a weekend we were seated fast.  Our waitress was great and the food came out quickly.  I had one of the skillets and it was perfect.  I have to mention the moonshine and koolaid...as it was a drink she tried and very good.  For after dinner we did the waffle and ice cream.  It was very good
3ma_7W3vZSD2fd6EosN3yQ,HptInOCjRLz9ddpkbaZpeQ,XQtA_XBehYAEJSWBxWMtDA,2.0,I got the fish and chips.  Fish really did not have much flavor and was kind of bland but was crispy.  Seems like a pretty cool sports (soccer) bar at night but for lunch not my favorite.  I would go if someone asked me to.  Atmosphere is pretty cool.  I was really hoping for more.  I may give it another try and order something different.  We went in a group of 4 and there were mixed reviews between the four us.
AV6weBrZFFBfRGCbcRGO4g,es15UP55rfli8OTgYr7cZA,nTSIvaErhSjtrC3cZq8OfQ,3.0,clean. far from the center of action. rooms are super inexpensive.
Md_TTNUkO7U47b3cass4gw,giJKPZbmZofGMS3f4vl5mg,Efu7MwM1OnHEAqwzXidYYg,2.0,This was my second visit to this location.  As stated in my quick tips; the lady I encountered working at the smoothie bar is not the friendliest.  ..LET'S BE CLEAR: The smoothies are YUMMY!.  I just don't like this location.  It is sub-par for what I've come to expect of Whole Foods.  And it doesn't help that the location on Mayo Blvd in Phoenix is incredible.  I will continue going there for the amazing customer service; variety of products and samples.
NvHGOIIukJ4y3iFswY-k8g,qBndnxpEdwlCcwGct8aQKg,foccCyQGyTlKjhr1UI9Z8g,1.0,It seems every time I eat here the food is even more disgusting than the previous visit. The product quality is terrible. You can taste how cheap everything is. First they switch their sausage supplier; which is a fellow small business within the community for garbage crumble. Now they've changed their already declining home fries to these cheap mini potatoes. Which were served to me practically raw. It's an absolute shame that the owner lives with himself knowing what a scam that place has become since he purchased it. They need to work with some soul in their.
j27Z_QgAakT6aM06MUXpYg,f8dRAxgqFnRH5l6AdbOf-A,O_BEqOSt6f_DuFCqWA5_KQ,5.0,Wife; Kids and I went for lunch on Jan 2.  We had sushi and hibachi.  Everything was excellent.  Server was prompt; polite; and brought my oldest easy chopsticks without us having to ask.  The food was delicious; portions large for lunch; and well priced.  Dinning area was clean; spacious and well decorated.  We will be back.
98VugO4QUbO5PsUKyGsd9w,Z1S31aUMCGrCTKtpkFfXhA,5Tqn9drxwOA6G9QEcEDGLQ,5.0,Had a wonderful dining experience at Drexyl's Restaurant tonight.  Started with a yummy Drexyl Marguerita.  Followed with the Chicken Arancini appetizer.  Then the Heritage Pork Chop.  What a wonderful meld of flavors.  The pork chop had a smoky flavor; was tender and cooked to perfection.  The apple butter; goat mac and cheese and bacon brussel sprouts all melted in the mouth.  We also had a great bottle of red wine - sorry I don't remember the name.  Was fortunate to be with a party who decided to share all three desserts.  All were great AND the Salted Caramel Brownie was out of this world...Everyone was very friendly and helpful and in particular our server Josh did a FANTASTIC job being attentive; knowledgeable and gracious...Great job Drexyl's. Definitely recommend and will return.
mnwRtuVQEsIUomBchu0gwg,GhX6pIeVsTolrqOvchXsSQ,trjYS896dUGhpCcg4Pp7cQ,5.0,Under very rare circumstances I visit Phoenix. However; if the weather isn't too unbearable; I thoroughly enjoy eating and drinking on the patio. I have been incredibly blessed continually having Athena as my server. Not only is she well versed in the food and drink items; she explains the dishes with such enthusiastic detail that my mouth is fervently awaiting the first bite. Luckily; the service is quite quick; even on a busy night..Dogs are allowed on the patio making the experience even more catered to my favorite things; cute animals; good food and drinks.
410NJLoLryd-vYNwRA58pw,oeFiWvoOG0hpMOXXxblfyQ,BfncHlZYbQpek9obrpM7-Q,4.0,Compared to Maison Kam Fung; I was happier dining at Ruby Rouge for the traditional dim sum brunching.  You walk into a small shopping mall; and as soon as you come off of the staircase you will appear in the center of the banquet hall.  This can be rather intimidating if you arrive during a busy hour and there are people waiting everywhere.  If you arrive between 10:00-11:00am; then you should have no problem getting nice seating.  By 11:30am; they were officially slammed with customers and there was a wait.  They do have many tables for two and four; so sharing a table should not be a necessity if you arrive in time...The set-up here is slightly different than any banquet hall dim sum dining experience I have had so far.  Mostly because of the layout and how you acquire the food.  Hot tea is complimentary.  Speaking in French is best; because some staff does not speak any English.  You will need a runner for your table if there are specific items you are looking for or you want the best items fast. The runner for my table was me; of course.  There is a bar with noodles and desserts; you will need to bring your bill ticket and request those items to have them fresh and carry them back to your table.  The meats are also carved at that same counter on the spot at your request with your ticket.  The pork here was sensational and came with a side of minced scallion sauce.  The soy sauce noodles were also good.  The crullers are here; but the congee is on cart.  ..Don't get me wrong; there are still carts going around all over the place; but the Montreal culture is much different; so you will not have cart pushers like you would in other cities.  You will need to ask for the items or ask to see what is on the cart; otherwise they will not bother you.  I am used to NYC; where staff will just put random food on your table and say; Eat!  You will like it!   Nothing like that happens "
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,XvLC9TbhXYiMIGArwJZTlw,N3bjcuHE5SWlywLkHkyHQw,5,A friend of mine recommended me to come to this place and I'm glad I listened to her....I liked the atmosphere; it is inviting and casual..They had a good variation of beers; I tried the stout and I really liked it..I noticed they have the beer flight which comes with 10 pints! It'd be fun to order it and try their different beers sharing with friends..I didn't get to try the food as I had just had lunch but I'd love to try it next time I go.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,IeJFKAMyMxwUrhA485xNqg,QC3DN48ZpazMP2aLUhqOAg,4,Wow pleasantly surprised even though it's a little bit of the chain; everything was great. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable on beers  and got me to something I really liked. Quinnona salad was fantastic. A big surprise for a beer place.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,DIR-zHbjtLUKtUoflZn3EA,cU3tLhOsf8W6ie1mUjQDKQ,4,My favorite thing about this place was the beer; especially the amber.  Definitely one of the better microbrewed beers that I've tried.  The food is your typical bar fare.  I remember enjoying my meal; but wasn't really blown away.  I agree with others who have said to come for the beer.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,-hKniZN2OdshWLHYuj21jQ,aFWHZUSZoXh3nLxbHNnqgw,4,We went here for a happy hour with friends.  I had yummy mojitos and hubby tried several beers.  We also had some appetizers.  Everything was delicious; the waitress friendly and patient (since we want to split the bill 100 different ways). ..A nice place to hang out with friends and chat and drink :)
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,TfXzHKa3AFDHKwUqzjJ83w,Gyj4HWe0rLEpDzZl8cSoKg,1,We go a lot... But today the waitress; Tanya; was plain rude; forgot our drinks; when she showed up 20 min when finishing food she did not even apologized and said kind of I guess I can get them for you now.. Dude we are ready to leave. Bad trained waitress considering place was 90% empty... ..Usually not bad establishment; but would think twice before going away.. Food was so so.. nothing crazy..
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,fVcdur3u2KqV0JcA3-Lo6Q,D5JEtGvDk7Je7jlQ8fxu8g,5,This is an awesome brewery.  We didn't have the food but we had a chance to grab some beer and some of that beer was delicious.  We did some day drinking here having a few beers trying basically every thing they had on the menu.  While i wanted the BIG beer flight (i think like 9 or 10 pints) my friends convinced me not to go for it and go for the smaller flights.  ..But that would have been epic; and we would have hung out there for a few hours longer haha.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,E24i9em5P9sKUZAtRaHwpQ,gbuZAakQFtKaeejuuXcahg,3,The beer was okay. Hoppiest offering was a IBU of 60. Service was poor; but they were crowded. Food was adequate.  Best thing about it was the ambience. Nice brass  brew kettles.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,I2hAUKfaY25fyyBRfpn2Lw,2,The food is ridiculously poor; except for the chicken wings which I could eat pound after pound. A good place for afterwork drinkage though.

dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,lbstebcfWBbXu4mE3r3m6w,JWAj9ZNC_L8GIP6KtcSaxw,4,Classic poutine paired with a pint of Amber. Both tasted great. Sat at the bar. Bartender very friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere. This was a perfect afternoon pit stop while sightseeing downtown.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,YO-4qGvk57ytVYD4E8ChlQ,TDFDM581DZyljNd4cEXirA,4,My wife and I went there hours after we arrived in Montreal for a mid afternoon snack.  Came back that night for a late night dinner.  Food is good and the selection of beer (I had the Stanley and the Brown) is great.  The room is good for sports (4 TVs and big screen on main floor; TVs upstairs as well) or a get together with a few people.  Staff is very accommodating and friendly.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,rEa_CEpd4fbbwhCw5z3LBw,T4qmhMkgXMRdEogi54N1ZA,3,Had the 3 brasseurs burger  (shredded lettuce; red onion; bacon and cheese) with poutine as the side. I'm not much of a beer drinker and had a long island ice tea which was good.  The atmosphere is noisy which was fine by me I was not here for that anyway. All in all I was happy with the meal.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,EDTvacqYYkrxEuDR6MhWsw,FevXu9bgC8MkfpNPU9XVdQ,3,Le hamburger 3 brasseurs était d'un gout bizarre. Leur steak mariné dans de la bière n'était pas de mon gout et trop cuit. On ne m'a pas demandé la cuisson..Les frites dans la mayonnaise maison a la moutarde a l'ancienne étaient en revanche excellentes...La flammekueche chèvre chaude était très bonne. De bonnes tomates; oignons et chèvre...J'ai eu du mal à finir ma pinte de la biere des fetes; elle était trop amer.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,BNSJ6dLbRsRB5yc-Zkn00w,N8yWyItZPimxZf7-Ri1pVw,5,The signature burger and raspberry  beer is a new flavor for me and is very good . The blend of bacon; and sauce is very tasty. The raspberry beer is light as well as there is not too much sweetness. Also it good location isn't far from my hotel.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,0xFHu8VFU52uBeir82ep8g,i0BeX5ZFaaXgRKFUf0Es6g,3,Super nice pour prendre un verre entre amis; mais la bouffe est bonne juste quand tu est pompette. Je suis allez ce midi pour dinner et ce n'etait pas ci bon que le soir quand j'y vais a l'habitude. La qualiter n'est pas constante.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,YP5hNfCZruMdByn6Ah6XpQ,mQUezuwkCPs-fTRijvrzjA,2,A international microbrew chain seems like a contradiction in terms. 3 Brasseurs first opened a few years ago in Montreal at this location and have been expanding in every direction ever since. I'm not sure why. I find their beer to be mediocre at best. It manages to be both too sweet and too bitter at the same time.  I'm tempted to say there's too much hops but my beer snob friends tell me there's no such thing as too much hops.  In any case; what I do know is that there are far better brewpubs in town that aren't chains and don't have the artificial ambience of an airport bar. I guess the main attraction for many is the free peanuts. The food is passable.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,in0aLEL8gC5MwNywqyrdUQ,NmwNPcfGop8nSSQenCUM_g,4,I enjoyed my first experience here so much I decided to come back for seconds during my 5 day stay in Montreal. Being a beer lover; this place is fabulous. I highly recommend the Amber; and order a pitcher. The service is great; the staff is friendly and attentive. I would give a 5 star if only the food met my expectations. I ordered the goat cheese and sun-dried tomato pizza my first visit; it was o.k; a bit dry and lacking flavour. On my second visit I ordered the trio-of-dip; which was FANTASTIC but it was only served with 6 small crostini slices which is far from enough to finish the appetizer. I did ask for more crostini but they came cold; stale and unlike the other ones from the original dish :( But thank you to our server Amanda for being so patient and kind. ..Overall; I would recommend this location for a night out with friends and the chance to try some new brews.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,VdZo9M4lahHokLpFVaGiIQ,-uG1kiyUOO-dPnqFC4wsJw,2,"While 3 Brasseurs can be very good on occasion; I find myself disappointed more often than not. ..When I discovered this place; maybe about 4 years ago; I felt as though the food was delicious and there was never a pint that didn't wow me....Now; on the few times I have been in the past 2 years; I feel as though not only has the food gotten average; but the beer has followed suit (it tastes off about 75% of the time).There is a great waiter on the ground level of this restaurant (I forget his name; but he's fantastic - nice; funny; and courteous).I have on the other hand had a lot of incompetent waitstaff and have had 0 comp from manager when it got that high (major drink screw ups - with the cocktails; would not change our drink because we had a sip; then when met with manager; manager stated you're lying; you ordered this! - I had ordered the Tango beer cocktail (beer and grenadine) i was given the Monaco beer cocktail (beer and tequila).The ambiance is ok; but gets loud fast and the screens are far and small..There are better pubs out there and don't expect to come here for under $20 per person....Overall 3 brasseurs has gotten very MEH for me.
FKOF8_OMvoPoDHOplDd7tQ,FddycBG2OGVO6M4PhckFVA,348h64v6GnjGxZut-VnO3A,1.0,Place has really gone downhill. I think management changed recently or something. Our favorite bartender was even let go. Don't understand what happened here but I won't be back.
kUuMZR8fPZjiCVcwPoNKlg,JMlW0wRW2I49qCUzaaVtvg,adIlCcAab_hQkbmyZv68Hg,5.0,My family (2 kids) visited here on a Monday night and I'm glad we did.  It was a great time to bring kids.  The place was relatively empty so my kids being loud wasn't an issue.  Not what I would call a little kids place (no kids menus; crayons; etc. for them while they waited for food).  This is an okay place for younger adults; but not little kids...The food was great.  Bruschetta appetizer was awesome and we got burgers and my wife got a chimichanga.  Se LOVED it (didn't stop talking about it).  Service was great too and loved the variety of beer they had to offer.  We got there for happy hour which had some nice specials.  We can't wait to go back.
fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,_UwZg-ztV7gc9u0zsRSHxA,-5dd5XW00ficoakFPtfpbQ,2.0,I first had Bbq for here several years ago at a catered event. The food was delicious. .Recently I placed a take out order. The guy on. The phone was very pleasant but he forgot to add a few things to my order. I wasn't charged so it wasnt a big deal. ..hey are always out of the beef ribs. I've heard they are delicious. Hopefully one day I'll get to try them. ..Bbw chicken. It's not a whole chicken. It's 8 separate pieces. Very tasty and moist. ..They were also out of the baked potato the night we ordered ..Brisket.  I ordered 2 lbs to make up for the lack of beef ribs. The brisket was dry and had a very bad after taste that made it taste like old meat that had been. I tried to mask it with the delicious sauce but I couldn't. It wasn't the smoke flavor. It just tasted like old meat that should have been thrown out. .The brisket has a very light smoke ring. Little to no bark. It was definitely not winning any awards. ..The sides were all ok. Nothing is ever crave but decent. ..I asked them for a variety of sauces but they only included one type. ..I'd go back but only because I'm still want to try the ribs.   The brisket was one of the worst I've ever had.  (Two pounds ended up in the trash). The chicken was good but over priced in my opinion.
mnwRtuVQEsIUomBchu0gwg,IicBAhuZxFHxLIP-5qiSCA,gtc-37HrrtiXQlIzugvhZA,5.0,LOVE THIS PLACE. Went to OHSO on date lunch with my husband; it was fantastic. Beer choice was just awesome and even managed to find a new favorite cider . I had the steak tacos and my husband had the shrimp. Both plates were just great superb flavor and plenty; the presentation was really good and just made you ant to go back again. Can't wait for a return visit
AV6weBrZFFBfRGCbcRGO4g,2R8wQ7JvDjwT1lMVWVEdxw,4gZqYRR8iEeQXCT8bGGSsw,3.0,I stayed at the Luxor for business. I had a conference in the Mandalay Bay and as these two hotels are interconnected (as well with the Excalibur to the other side). this seemed a goodf choice. The prices are on the lower side compared to the Mandalay Bay. I give the hotel three stars; but I mus say I am rating it in the higher 3...I arrived late on a Saturday after a 14 hour flight from The Netherlands. The checkin line was long so I had to wait half an hour before being checked-in. Check-in was friendly. The room was spacious and although I booked for one person; there were two large beds. ..I was staying in the pyramid part (there are also towers which are said to be newer.) looking out on MCCarran airport. Being an aviation geek; this is awesome as it give excellent views on runways 01R/19L and 01L/19R. But this view is somewhat distorted by the dirty windows. I guess maintaining a glass structure like the Luxor requires lots of effort; but nevertheless this was noticable. In no way had this a negative impact on my stay as far as comfort goes...Wifi acces is great! No complaints. TV is modern; but didn't use it all that much...Overall I had a pleasant stay; but I do have some remarks:..1. Food court prices and of the small grocery shops are high compared to other hotels like Excalibur. As the Luxor is farther away from the Strip and its cheap shops to buy drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) the prices are probably a bit higher. Add to that the somewhat worse dollar/euro currency rate and 5 dollar for a yoghurt/muesli dairy product is a bit on the high side to put it mildly. Another option is to take an Uber/cab (or walk 45 minutes along S Las Vegas Blvd in southern direction adjecent to the airport perimeter) to the Whole Foods market and buy some groceries there..2. My planning was to have some laundry done and the website stated that this was possible. But during check-in I was told only dry-cleaning was possible. But in the room I found a bag and note offering laundry services as well. After checking this with the Bell desk I learned laundry services were offered indeed (just as the bag and note would assume) so all in all; this worked out fine and my laundry was done anyway. But I was a bit confused and I was already checking out if there were laundry services nearby; but this would involve taxi's and other assorted transportation; just to have some socks and shirts done. ;-).3. Bathroom is OK; but some places show their age. The faucet is not tightened (but functional) and there is some calcification around the showerhead. .4. The airco unit works; but also saw some better days. .5. The escalators (the diagonally ones) are functioning (and probably subjected to regular; state-mandatory checks anyway); but had a bit of a clunky feel to it. Small remark: due to the friction of the carpetting when walking on rubber soles I was being discharged by the metal escalator buttons. Maybe some other non conductive materials can be used here. ..Overall a nice stay; but be aware that especially the prices for common food products like drinks and small bites to eat is higher compared to the rest of the strip. The room rates are lower though; so it's a trade off and you have to decide what's more important. Either spend more money on food/drinks or take a short walk to Excalibur and/or Strip and buy for far lower prices.
3GuqcEYaF1d1WXcwOX5xPw,-XgVXGJnOnW0kQEol6O3Pg,4HrrnQ0PAYCMyO0ujbhuNw,5.0,So I never in a million years would of tried this place if it wasn't for a great groupon deal I found!..Went here on a Friday for brunch and it was amazing! .I tried the Bacon; eggs; and asparagus OH MY!! It was a very interesting combination which I ended up loving. First there was a bed of crunchy hash browns with a layer of bacon and asparagus covering them. I got it topped with 2 eggs over easy along with a side of wheat toast. Everything was cooked perfectly to my liking with decent portion sizes too. .Then my brunch buddy for the day opted for a special they were having which was a mushroom frittata with cheese along side fresh greens. The greens looked delicious and he was very happy with the meal. I didn't get a chance to taste it but the greens looked fresh but the frittata seemed a bit unappealing to look at. I was told it tasted fantastic and to me thats what matters. .The wait staff was very nice and informative on the menu and our food came out in a timely manor. .The decor was very interesting as well. There was a local artist showing off her oil paintings which was awesome they support the local art scene only part of that I didn't like was someone stopped at our table and started taking pictures behind me of the art work which was a bit uncomfortable since I was shoveling food in my mouth lol. .Like to try this neat delicious little spot again and explore the menu more
Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,Zlwl4JljrFIFa898oHteyQ,5.0,This place is one of my most favorite Thai Restaurants.  When I think of Weera; Kin Thai; Siri Thai; Sakun Thai; Naga; Gaati; Komol; Lotus of Siam; Lucki and all the other places in town; I love coming back to Table Thai Bar and Bistro...1. Service - The staff here are very nice and friendly. You always feel welcome here.  they are very attentive and making sure you are taken care of. Even when it is busy; they are available...2. The Food - The food here is great...Lunch - For about 7-10 dollars; you can order 1 of about 10 specials from curry to spicy basil or pad thai.  Your will have a nice lunch size serving of the dish; as well as soup; rice and a small salad. I find that this is a great deal and the amount of food is just right.  Great food; great flavor and great price. Can't beat that...Entrees - They have just about any and all Thai dish that you could want.  I won't go into any great details as the choices are similar everywhere.  Here are some highlights though:..Ground Meat - I love to have ground pork on my Thai dishes and some places have it; and some don't. HEre they have the ground pork. It captures the sauce and spicy flavors so much better than larger cuts of meat.  The best part; is that they can do ground chicken as well.  I generally prefer the consistency of the ground meats in Thai cooking. Not many places can do ground pork or ground chicken!..Tom Yum - I always enjoy it when the soup comes out in the soup hot pot with the fire in it steaming. Here it is just right and slurpiliciously good...Vegan Menu - Many places will have a vegetarian menu; but here they have a separate Vegan menu. That is great; especially since the daughter has been a vegan now for about 5 months...3.  Ambiance - The amount of tables; the design and everything about this very small restaurant is just right. I love coming here with the family and also on business lunch meetings...GK says; check it out. One of my favorite Thai restaurants.
PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg,7w2G0I2U_zV_UkAc3f6pEQ,ryKmgdz3Jvg_bNMiNSa2UQ,5.0,My girlfriend and I had brunch at Fez this weekend. What a perfect way to start off our day. It's hard to find restaurants that have great food and a fun atmosphere like Fez. ..But what made it one of our best dining experiences was our server; Jared.  Not only did he make sure we had everything we needed; but he knew when he needed to ask. We like to take our time when we dine out and have a few drinks (the Greyhounds are so good here and only $4 during brunch!)... Jared just let us enjoy our time (about 2 hrs); and he knew exactly when we needed something without hovering. How he did; I have no idea; but he definitely has that skill down. ..Try Fez; you won't be disappointed. And ask for Jared if you really want great service.
KYr67K-Ot9HKkv90KaXL5w,4ULUWqda23gUl_VylJ2OAw,YlMX6w5sWQuj90UU7_EFiQ,3.0,Nice; large; soft crepes. I got the strawberry; whipped cream and cheesecake crepe.  They put the cheesecake in the microwave to heat it up but it was still cold and hard when I ate it. To be honest; there was too much cheesecake but the crepe itself was pretty decent.
9UX9_Vec2gxrrHvBjdzXgQ,-ZsAF6YOSzfCwRMvwgkwHw,qi9_ETCLwDg0hE6K98HEfw,4.0,Ya; it's Italian food. The menu has some eye catching options; there was some thought and it shows...For a restaurant located inside a tourist attraction; it was still very nice. At least it looks really nice; a great first impression maker. And with pasta what more do you need then atmosphere anyway?..The service was amusing (the guys were a bit neurotic); but very professional. I felt very taken care of. As I usually do in nicer Italian restaurants.

The  Pear and Gorgonzola was unique. The Bronz Bomber had good flavor and a nice balance of ingredients. Personally I would have like them to be a little more crispy. But; that's just a personal preference. ..What I really liked was that the manager came to each table to introduce himself and make sure the customers were happy. It's rare to see managers touch tables! Great customer service and great food
l6ZrDTwUHZebCG3C9Va3Dw,iBYfTfQCZs7UTvJ9X2VXew,IJtsUqU_JPh6fZ7vl4g6Eg,5.0,This is the one restaurant in Pittsburgh my friends and I can always agree on. The specials never disappoint! The chicken is always cooked tenderly to perfection and the sweet potato chips are worth an order. It took me four years to find this place because the location is slightly obscure. I wish I'd found it sooner!
mnwRtuVQEsIUomBchu0gwg,vHaxYeTciV7IbPFu2uBjiw,ujEMbUlWklhe-QRHRuioqA,5.0,Is a really fun restaurant brewery which captures all that is Phoenix. ..They have a huge selection of beer most of them brewed on site and that cover the spectrum of flavors. ..Have a solid standard bar menu.

I have left happy every time I've visited.   ..Things that rock:  Chicken sandwich; rotisserie chicken; fried rice plates; any of their sides; and of course -- the dipping sauces!!
BX__XFuHZKp6AZ3RBE77Bw,O_BRwJogrBqGi9mfrF0Xsg,bpTiKm_kpUCpYsELRnZVEw,1.0,The 1 star is specifically for the chicken roti;  the actual experience was great. I'm sorry to say that the roti was essentially inedible. I've had to toss almost all of it. By an order of magnitude; the worst roti I have ever had. All respect to the people who love this place... just way below par for me. I was craving the amazing taste I get consistently over at Island Foods (King and Dufferin) and; well... this is a very disappointing alternative. My mistake for not just doing the drive! I was the only customer there as they opened today and I'm pretty sure I heard the microwave going just before my order hit the counter. Dunno what to make of that... yesterday's filling? Service was great and friendly; Portion size is immense. Even the washroom was spotless. Unfortunately for Calabash; the food is why one returns. I won't return.
kPwYdRKp1-W1-tUR8iylxw,vUyr0O72btWjs1HqZRc4EA,y5OUGGgblt4BFC2c-bWs6Q,4.0,This is one restaurant I have to eat at every time I'm  in the Burgh. I have eaten at this location as well as the Fox Chapel location which is my favorite.  I always order the mediterranean lamb plate its always cooked perfectly and always tastes great. Desserts are not bad either. Nice spot for a healthy meal.
NwWYSYGHFyHQMmsXu0SiYA,qNSrUmf4RFsNqdMCeKI7Ow,CmXvlP40lvShILizPCxX7A,2.0,This place has really declined. I will give them this the wings are still good. The burgers are nothing special. I have had better fast food burgers like cook-out for half the price. If you want a over priced meh type burger here you go.
iUYAqWKoBdHqYNMDzOXb9w,olMvy2yYS7qvUqjkE2qucQ,Lwwcbnkf7ayZgsNwVOXjDw,5.0,To parapphrase the newspaper review that proudly stands on the counter of this quaint restaurant; Don't come here; because if you to start coming regularly; this place is small enough where there won't be enough room for me...Delicious!..The food is great; the prices even better.  3 Large Empanadas for $5.95?  It can't be beat...The Ecuadorian Ceviche is a wonderful dish to order and share.  It comes in a large heavy glass goblet; almost theatrical; but if you want to impress some people; this is definitely fun to order.
Se7xRX2Ys3ab7kH3xUcFXw,dfIOLWBUkZvULJUqDeJ-Nw,SNr0Z7Ky8TqQpuXCkgRS0A,4.0,Very good Starbucks; excellent service; plenty of seating midday on a Sunday; handy to the Old Port. Sandwiches are great too.
2gUbgbdJ7IFSbicBXlSchw,RhKxw4kP1V3mlxJXtyEZXw,EIBcLc3C_pOTrLwp2VfURg,1.0,We went here as so many people raved about it on yelp! Thought I was the luckiest person to score a table last minute at 5 in the evening. .The bread was so average for a highly rated place! The octopus salad was ok. Quiche was good. Steak frites was average nothing to rave about. And the chicken breast was way over cooked! It was DRY and were it not for the mustard sauce it sat on it was tasteless! .Seriously save your money and your selves! Go somewhere else! I don't understand what the hype is all about to the point that it's booked every night! People do you not know REAL good food (?) that you actually say this place is great?????!!? So sad; as this was our last night and I really wanted it to be a good meal!

We had the 5 meat sampler and famed Outlaw burger and both were incredible. ..I have experienced some joints that do a couple of meats well but fall short on others; this place is knocking it out of the park. Brisket was juicy; pork was tender; sausage had great flavor; and chicken was smoked just right. The ribs tasted fantastic but we're not as juicy as I like; again this was the sampler so I think a slab will be juicier...Sides of Mac n cheese; hush puppies & bacon mashed potatoes were also delicious. With drinks total came to $45 for a family of 5. They do have 10% coupon on the website. Do not leave Vegas before trying Rollin Smoke!

irsqHZvvMdwK5iM3mFZ5Pg,D4Eznn83MRWUK39n5WI0JA,wi67c_9EJY-wGKRB7ylM3w,2.0,Bleeeeh.  Desperate to escape from the dinner at my hotel bar yet again; I opted for...dinner at a different hotel bar!  I was lured by brasserie and wine bar.   If you're following along; you know that I should really know better.  ..I learned an interested factedote today--PA liquor laws force restaurants to buy wine at the same price that it retails.   That might explain the wackadoo pricing all over town; and especially at this place.   I'm getting incredibly sick of places that call themselves wine bars that serve Mark West Pinot Noir; Sterling Merlot and Chateau St. Michelle Chardonnay.  Not all of these suck; but not exactly what one looks for in a wine bar.  ..The food.  Why call yourself a brasserie if you're serving average american hotel food?  My pan roasted chicken served over fresh pasta was a big old bowl of fettucine alfredo with chicken hunks and some artichoke hearts and mushrooms thrown in for flavor.  ..The blowhard next to me; talking at me; made me flee with the check as soon as I could.
-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA,-aAgfEUH4UoFDRXZCfJSUA,kluQ-jKNEOwBdU9c6kX7AA,5.0,I am still reeling from my lunch here; dreaming about it; planning my next trip. I don't know what else to say other than I was totally surprised by how fantastic my lunch was. A Zinburger with truffle fries. Sat at the bar by myself; was on my way to the airport. Wasn't that hungry. I thought about taking the napkin to remember the place by. I don't know what you could find wrong with these burgers; truthfully one of the best I've ever shoved in my piehole.

uanCi4OGc1mHLGl_AT4JhQ,UsmTxWbobLsI6WR1Db0W7A,T47T0gqyUmobfwjTFlKJrg,4.0,This is my favorite hotel in Vegas. I love the atmosphere; the food; the casino; and just about everything else about TI. Last time here my travel agent got me a flight out of Pittsburgh with a brief layover in Cincinnatti (stayed on the plane; a boarded a few passengers) and was in Vegas 5 hours later. We each got a single room with a huge king size bed for 327; including airfare; 5 days and four nights. We could not pass up this deal. It departed the day after thanksgiving and Vegas was pretty barren. ..When we checked it; the front desk clerk gave us a coupon book good for many free items; including some things located right at Treasure Island. One of the items was a coupon good for twenty five dollars in slot play up the street at the Stratosphere. There were also free meals; BOGO buffets; two for one helecoptor tours of Hoover Dam; ETC...The rooms were huge; nice and clean except for one thing; my toilet didn't flush; I called the front desk and they apologized and sent up a bellhop to get my bags and upgraded me to a suite. What a great suite it was too. Nice living room area; walk in closet; and giant bedroom with a california king sized bed. I could travel like this a lot!..Great casino here at TI; I found the slots to be pretty loose; the blackjack dealers are extremely friendly; and; they have a great sportsbook...It's not one of the newer hotels; but this place is still my favorite place on the strip to gamble; and stay when I come to Vegas. They treat you right.

It was recommended by a coworker; and I have passed the word to everyone I know since going there. Wild East has only been open a couple of weeks; and to find a new restaurant doing such an amazing job is refreshing. Ambience is very Zen; staff is friendly and efficient; sushi is the best in Charlotte (Rock & Roll; Paradise; or Tiger Roll--all delicious!); unique summer rolls; great stirfry; etc.; etc. I can't stop going back. Check out the grand opening drink specials; plus lunch specials and some sushi specials too. Highly recommended for everyday or a great date spot!

uIovmfzrCcJIlzfbpj_hzg,X5hySWB8MkeR1fbsR96POw,33lYafYKemeyHbpcH9XzFA,4.0,This is a great Trader Joe's. I love the reasonable prices for quality healthy foods. It is a much better value than Whole Foods. I'd argue that it's often more reasonably priced than Giant Eagle as well--especially when it comes to health food...Trader Joe's has a great list of vegan products: http://www.traderjoes.com/pdf/lists/list-vegan.pdf Not all of their vegan products are listed; but most of them are. Highlights are their soy ice creams; vegetable gyozas; and vegan rice krispy treats...My only real complaint is that it often gets stuffy. Like many Trader Joe's; it isn't big enough for how popular it is. It gets kind of stressful when there's a crowd of people in there; and you're trying to navigate around everyone while the poor Trader Joe's employees are trying to stock the shelves as the food is flying off the shelves. Tip: Try to go during the less busy times; such as the weekday evening or if you must go on the weekend--go during the early morning (before 10am).
jpwO2gB4zb5MDh3P61Sm8A,leAnil_G7_uBcLtz0WfgJQ,rEz-rOardHyW8gZpw0TCkw,5.0,Great place to get work done. It's hard to get a mobile signal in their meeting area though (at least for T-Mobile and AT&T) They have comfortable seats and I never have a problem finding an outlet. ..Love the outdoor seating and they have the best dirty chai I've tasted. Friendly staff and a room you can reserve for meetings.
WymLKyWx3t9V3VfI7itMtA,pFsNWwM1UPTW-z8SguUA_w,KqcCpsGTJfRBDFr83SF7QA,4.0,The place was packed when we showed up an we had to wait a little bit for our reservation. I will give the benefit of the doubt being it was a Saturday. Once we were seated the service was great! Our tapas were amazing. The lamb chops were a little over cooked but overall everything was delicious!! I will totally come here again; especially in the spri ad summer to enjoy the outdoor patio!
4VIAadQ0yZGss1vNHWUk9g,dUO81xbm1zQCqG1UJpVLug,bZ3ealq4qrEJ76FDbdym5A,1.0,Very disappointed.  We ordered the roast beef sandwich with a side of potato wedges.  Both were cold and the potatoes had the strangest seasoning I ever tasted; really bad.  I've had better roast beef at Arbys.

tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,uEQ3nCdOBNOeJ0ow4Ds1vA,4RjqHKv8yTyeFivsqILK-w,3.0,After a tour of the Mob Museum; a couple of blocks north of Fremont Street in the somewhat seedy downtown area of Vegas; we walked to the nearby Triple George Grill. It's a popular lunch stop; and was quite busy. The interior is old school; but the place was built in 2005. The food was fairly typical bar and grill fair; nothing special.
XVykuRX60his8F2H6UW8Bw,N0qq4upibIRvLzE2SzVPtQ,UVkz8ZXEVV9-xsHaCrchSA,3.0,I remember when we moved to Leslieville I was excited to have a No Frills so close to home. Plus; it has all the ethnic goodies that I usually need to source for whatever it is I am making. But now; after many months I have begun to see the shortcomings.  We eat a very produce/grains heavy diet so luckily I only need to shop at a conventional grocery (for packaged; tinned; frozen etc) every so often. ..Major Issues.- NO Veggie Meats; Ever. Barely ever any tofu. Sometimes I need ground round.- Some Organics; but Not the best. (check the dates on the organic milk etc).- Produce is so so. Their Chinese Broccoli/ Asian Greens are awful but China Town is nearby if you need those..- Anything EVER advertised as on Sale is gone once you get there. (but thats every no Frills).- No decent Seafood; Only Prepackaged Meats..- Terribly inadequate bicycle parking forces me to lift bike onto handrail of walkway to chain up - and then I am also covered in bicycle grease WORST..- Saturday mornings this place is an absolute nightmare. Avoid at all costs...Really; I get it. I am a food snob. I should be going to Whole Foods but the budget doesn't permit it - so I need to mix it up from time to time. This No Frills is moments from my place; so it gets bonus points for convenience.  We used to go to No Frills in Parkdale; and sometimes I visit the one at Sherborne or Coxwell as they are closer to work and gym - compared to all of those this one is a true gem.  Compared to Markham its a pit...All I want is nicer produce; vegetarian options and some fresh sustainable Seafoods and I would be perfectly happy. And for the cashiers to not allow people with 6pack of Pepsi already shrink wrapped with handle attched to use a plastic bag to carry it home in. Gah.
wOKcWLyN1DhSEl3Y1eG5nQ,20Q1V7rHvPUfLlfsvb-4HQ,9DfdZo8l_oJ3RCX5BlsNow,5.0,I heard about this restaurant 10 years ago and it took 5 years to get here once I moved to Ohio.  It has been outstanding each time I have had the pleasure of dining here. .We met friends for brunch on Sunday. Soft eggs is a simple but delicious dish. The pulled pork Benedict was truly wonderful. .The melon board seasoned with ancho was very tasty and beautifully presented. .I have moved out of Ohio but flying fig is only 2 hours away!
zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA,tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,UAKauzfau8ThhdMYf_dQqw,2.0,Before moving to Vegas years ago; I liked Todai.  Back in the Midwest; we didn't have Japanese buffets.  Simple ol' me from 6 years ago was content with their sushi; sashimi; tempura; desserts; etc.  It's called settling...Then when I moved to Vegas 6 years ago and started trying AYCE sushi restaurants; I was enlightened.  I started noticing things that I didn't before.  Loosely made rolls; dry sushi rice from sitting in the open too long; imperfectly cut sashimi (I'm hoping they don't use a butter knife to slice fish) -  all these details started to bother me.  That's the problem with chains - quality isn't there...The location is good.  You can just do valet right outside Planet Hollywood (east side).  So; if you're a tourist or don't know any better; Todai might be ok until you try smaller AYCE sushi restaurants this city has to offer...You can eat for free on your birthday.  They have a chocolate fountain and that's about it.
c-Ur4wPDNjt-e2N5MkRRaQ,SBEvMN7LKwdQMi3GyelQYg,lVNvNIr6xVGAmLy1aasycw,1.0,Hmmm; how very odd. I have written a review for this place previously but it seems to have disappeared completely despite that I recall seeing it posted. Anyway; In Toronto; there are tons of great places to eat. This is not one of them; the portions are small; they charge you for tea and the prices are high. There is so many better places to go for Dim Sum. The only positive thing I can say about this place; is that they didn't charge me for the dish I found the short; black curly hair on. .You're best bet for Dim Sum is to eat elsewhere
pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw,-0-R267zNIQDPI9rxJlprQ,dHjBkjWOuIu_6ZxAIaHy5A,3.0,Good buffet; horrible service.  Dishes piled up on the table; impossible to get a refill and not very friendly.  It looked like on of the owners was sitting there rolling a mountain of silverware instead of lending a hand!  We couldn't get a check and left  extra (plus tip) just to make sure we paid in full..Too bad because the food was very good.
qO_nFskODvrG9O8SNdUY7g,v4fT6mIxgjho_CLR2wiXvg,0wbIeHCqNJUzQ0x6GuQcNQ,3.0,I have mixed feeling about this place. We have been in a few times. I really like the decor and set up. The bar area is really nice. The food is pretty good. I think I like the breakfast more than the dinner. They have a really awesome chorizo eggs Benedict with a chipotle cream sauce that is sooo good. Where I have issues is the service. It tends to be pretty slow and we have definitely encountered some grumpy people. If the staff is not happy it does not make me want to come in. Hopefully they can get things figured out because it's a really cool spot.
9EytPnh_lzU6STtd6cljCQ,C_4-Emd614NpAVzOdCXfJA,cCTg2NY8vBKmU1dlVxd7ng,4.0,If iPic were a swanky Scottsdale nightclub; Ferelli's would be Applebees. Affordable; comfortable; and fun.  The place does smell like it's been there forever; but I felt like it was clean and decent quality. Our server was really nice; even when I told him we weren't ordering entrees. We had two appetizers- crab dip and chicken nachos. Both were good. Also ordered dessert but it never came. It was just a miscommunication between servers. No biggie. I would definitely go back with a group of friends or my family.  ..The movie screen was big; picture quality was good; and the sound LOUD (which was good for the action movie we saw)...I bought a coupon off Deal Chicken which made the evening super affordable (less than $50 for 3 people's tickets; sodas; appetizers; and tip).  ..Side note: There are three levels of seating. It seemed like the front section would've been too close.

I am a big eater and love to save money... this was a no brainer after reading a few reviews. The staff was great; food was delicious and came out in a timely manner (in and out within an hour). I would recommend getting there before 5 because it is a popular spot! Take my advice and give this place a shot; enjoy.

D3ehpx1uKG5aLuaJgztYDg,OOhrFCqdskytAZqiwjx-Xw,lwqSPKS6TKYAztL35AAjIA,4.0,One thing my boyfriend and I like to do during the hot days of summer is to relax and read a good book while sipping an iced coffee at a local coffeehouse.  This week we went to Solo Cafe.  We were kind of hungry so we thought maybe we could get a sandwich there.  Unfortunately; they do not have a kitchen and the only food they serve are pastries at this time.  Luckily Solo is in a strip mall with food options.  We left and came back.  I had an Iced Cafe Latte and my boyfriend had a Iced Cafe Mocha.  Both very good drinks.  Also; the barista was very nice and seem really laidback and cool.  Another plus is that they have free wi-fi.  Important for me because I was doing catching up on some work while my boyfriend read his book.  This is definitely a place we will go back to.

iCjZlOs3qL1_HhAQBW9smg,3optl9x5LNX40C34Smk4ww,yRk4QS6SX2jw933PtzB39A,2.0,Came during lunch; took about 15 mins to get an order in for two people and then another 47 minutes for the actual food to come. Sushi quality was good; service and speed of food especially for an average one hour lunch break was awful.
vyEetoXzGq9vBTWpOu85pQ,q0x5bFJHaKO7YTXw1l8g9g,WzDEpZQ9-wqJAtWAsQo4Gw,2.0,Ordered a pick up order and timed my distance to about 15 minutes out. Phone communication was normal; no attitude and received the order without trouble. Person said my order would be ready in 15 minutes so it seemed perfect. Once I arrived; the staff was friendly but very stiff. Offered the greeting then went on like a robot doing their job. It did not look busy inside at all but they were moving around not in a hurry but as if they were behind on something. Maybe it was my order. I did arrive exactly 15 minutes later but still had to wait another 15 minutes there by the front door. Not sure if this was a young staff with poor leadership or just a new place where things aren't running smoothly yet. Regardless; was craving some wings and got the same ol; same ol. Wings are just average but Im sure ill find the good wings in the area later.
KOEBBp2PhiV_4PkW9eo9Sg,uegNuvRUU-z4FwFo2aJpcw,kRVHBSwUFLfWax11dnDRSA,4.0,First impression very busy during lunch. The lady at the cash register was able to provide a recommendation which is a plus in my book. Casual atmosphere and clean. The lady told me they've been at this location for two years. I guess I've passed it up several times. I am always over here shopping at Old Navy and Justice for my youngest. ..Now for the food. It smells delicious! It is enough for two people. It was a little salty for me but everything is salty since I've been pregnant. The rice was perfect with the exception of a few hard pieces but that happens everywhere. ..The lady came out to check on me. I'm now starting to think that she is the owner. I couldn't eat it all. I felt bad because I was wasting food. Nevertheless I will return. I'm interested in tasting the other items on the menu. I'm anxious to try the humus. I love a good humus.
TQxMhEar6--Wj4Du8nRQsw,rlSqxLf4MWGcEI6kL3tmBw,3_4CX8Lcl2WawhJxMRIlIg,2.0,I was really hoping for better; stopped in for some quick Pad Thai take out before heading to class at the ASU downtown campus. To be honest; the portion size is just ok; but why this review is only getting 2 stars is because I ordered and paid for extra shrimp... I got a total of 7; I also asked for it to be spicy; its sweet; actually its to sweet and i'm very disapointed over all. I may give it another shot if pei wei is extremly busy otherwise I get what i pay for their.
vIAEWbTJc657yN8I4z7whQ,Okng6mFsTTTjfnHytg6wjw,g6SJZGw4cbp3A6xo64w2Tg,1.0,The employees at this location have the worst attitudes I have ever seen at any Starbucks location. I usually frequent this location because it's on the way to work; but after today never again...I ordered my usual grande iced hazelnut latte and a ham and cheese square. My latte came out fairly quickly and looked like it was missing a shot of espresso. It looked and tasted more like hazelnut milk with a splash of espresso. I told the barista my drink didn't taste right and his response was I'll make it again and it's going to taste the same. Unbelievable.

I would have been the next in line if she had served me. Rude is all i have to say about this store. Maybe ignorant as well. Doubt I'll shop much at Albertson any more. Overpriced as well; compared to other stores who offer the same service.

nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,3Gcb--Vsp1zG0CXU7xtZYw,EspH8awu4DfeLDmnEECejA,4.0,Came here specifically so the bf can eat the dry aged NY sirloin. We first heard about dry aged beef on food network; and were intrigued by the aging process. Last summer; while strolling by NY NY on the last day of our vegas trip; we walked by Gallagher's. Unfortunately at that time; we didn't have time to try their steak and the bf left vegas disappointed. ..For the holidays; we trekked back to vegas...and a part of me thinks we went back to vegas to satisfy my bf's intrigue of the dry aged NY sirloin. So to appease the bf; we went here. He of course had the NY sirloin; and I had the filet mignon.  And to give Gallagher's credit...the NY sirloin was yummy; but it didn't taste that much different than a wet aged piece-o-meat. ..The filet was small but cooked to perfection. ..Overall; very enjoyable. ..However

I got a angle hair pasta; and let me tell you; I love noodles in general; but these where pretty awesome; I mean; I almost finished my plate! The service was nice; but there was a bit of a wait; but I did like it very much.
8_hy-FrbC9zcakjKH_yaXA,3cBVCNsm273EJ_GM4FVvJg,yppKSqYAnxAYemz6XLHc7Q,5.0,So open for a week at this location. Located Downtown Las Vegas where a much needed taco was in very much need! Place is clean and very cute with some beginnings of murals painted by Chef Robert himself. So; not only does he cook some delicious food but he brings his artistic talents to create a great atmosphere. The menu has a little bit of everything. So; I began with the basics when it comes to tacos.  Carne Asada -  Fine diced onions/ cilantro with a guajillo sauce (not spicy and very tasty); fresh guacamole and light cheese all on a small (street tacos size corn tortilla) super hot which is the way any taco should be served in order to enjoy the freshness of the guacamole and other fresh ingredients. Next I had the Carnitas - same construction as the asada except with pork carnitas.  Next had the Al Pastor which was very good. Probably not my favorite of everything I had; but definitely worth trying. Why was it not my favorite? It's more of  home made al pastor not shawarma style which in my opinion is what a true al pastor should be all the time no exceptions but none the less good flavor. I then moved on to the Braised Brisket which by far was the best of them all. Fresh Romain; guajillo; pico; a dap of sour cream; fresh guacamole and topped off with just the right amount of cotija cheese all in a crispy warm shell corn tortilla. To finish it all the rock shrimp tacos which were good..In my opinion best and must have's are:  Braised Brisket; Carne Asada and Carnitas. ..They have veggie and vegan menu options (which I will try next time I stop by) ..Currently they do serve beer; Mexican Coke and other Mexican drinks as well as fresh waters are coming soon...They will also be expanding the menu to burritos and some other seafood options.  .Bomb Tacos are bomb and glad to have them downtown!  Perfect place to go eat after being on Fremont Street on a late weekend. Open until 2am on weekend and midnight during the week.  .Thank you Chef Robert & Team for bringing some quick; easy and enjoyable tacos to our Great Downtown Las Vegas!

We sat by the bar where the chefs cook and it was really awesome to see them while I drank wine. My boyfriend and I tried about 4 of dishes and we couldnt decide which one we liked the best because they were all so good. Everyone was also super nice and really paid attention to us. .I cant wait to go back the next time I visit Toronto.

There was an alarm pulled at 4 am. Alarms all going off for a long time without any more information given. We were starting to panic. Check out is at 11. We had someone knock on our door and 9; 10; and were standing outside our door as we were exiting at 10:58. We stayed a couple years ago and had a better experience; but unfortunately this time we weren't so lucky
xhIFWOW9MfwWzW4tUK-jdQ,u2orEOJwWMCq_0BNH8dk1Q,0c9qHl5V_L0E7BxsYRcDhA,5.0,Best Wings...Best Pizza!! Tried this place on a fluke and wow- it was impressive. A little wait for the food but if you place your order early and give them a time they'll have it delivered to your house at that time. Great service. Small place I don't think there.Is a place to sit down; but definitely delivers! Lots of toppings; great crust- not think- not thin- Just perfect!
0TgBr7wAMQOij6_JP9q3ag,wi_a3hdD7pnZU4mzjCbdIw,oXAa7Dx_U-o3IbhXmWTLuA,2.0,The reason why this review is a 2 and not a 1 is because I have ordered food online here before and the food was okay for the price...My last experience here was horrible!  I walk in and there are 2 employees behind the counter.  One is behind the register and the other is doing something with the toppings.  I wait for a little bit; the girl doing the toppings finally looked my way and here expression was like What the F**k are you doing here? and she goes back to her toppings.  I look at the door to see the hours of operations and then at my phone.  They are open for another hour.  Then another customer walks in and I guess the employees can't ignore the both of us.  I order a side Cesar and the large Loaded Potato Pizza.  Big sigh from the employee because they don't have the larger size pressed and she has to get an employee to press one for me (and subsequently the guests behind me).  I go to check out and she has forgotten my salad but my gut says don't even mention that.  I pay for my drink and pizza and she start complaining to me that people are coming is and she is suppose to be off.  Awkward!!  I get my drink and try to find a clean table.  As I'm waiting for my pizza a notice a puddle of cola growing from under my glass.  I pick up the glass and there is a steady drip from a hole in the bottom of the glass.  I try to get the employees attention but they are too busy talking to one another.  So I go to the counter with my drink dripping all over the place.  Still can't be bothered to help me.  So I leave the glass with the hole on the counter.  My pizza comes and it's not good.  It's soggy in the middle and all the toppings just slide off.  I ate what I could.  When I left the oozing glass was still on the counter in front of the register with the puddle just getting bigger.
Uq-GOs9_IqweUsB5MdII9w,AlKvHPDnE7jIvcWix4Ce_w,PYupdUkFXJoSL9pLAiR-pA,4.0,This is a great place to eat. Breakfast and brunch has become a huge event on St.Clair and this plaza meets those expectations. The breads are fresh and organic. The meals are very good as well. The atmosphere is very family based and chilled back. The price is going rate for this neighborhood. It's another hidden gem on st Clair. Give it a try. The weekends are very busy so b prepared to wait.

AV6weBrZFFBfRGCbcRGO4g,wEnNhKTWaIh_zlngQ7S-TQ,oNUzs88lgLMiwZEaSK8NYQ,2.0,My wife and I came to Luxor to watch Jabbawockeez. It's been a while since I've been here. When we first got there; we didn't know where the box office was so we asked a worker for help. He told is where it was then tried to sucker us into a timeshare meeting. We already knew about those people that try to get you to do a meeting to get free or discounted show tickets. So we were prepared to say no. It started to become a habit each time we walked by those timeshare workers. They would always bother you asking if you wanted discounted show tickets. It happened multiple times while we were there. This was really annoying as they are waiting in the walkways to prey on the people who don't know. This is something that will probably make me not come back here. ..The casino itself is ok. Nothing really exciting about this place. It feels nostalgic being there since I remember coming when I was a kid to ride the rides and watch the shows. It doesn't seem like they've upgraded this place and it's stuck in the past. I give this place 2 stars due to the annoying timeshare people that harass you nonstop!

G4LzA_UqrzcZ5gAyWWP2sw,TVp6TO4EIk1P-IxbCg5bFw,mV-BONb_iB9tv7q8z8XP3w,2.0,I had the seafood pancake and tofu soup.  They don't quite make it like other traditional Korean restaurants.  The pancake was made of mostly eggs and not of any flour base.  Takamatsu makes this 1000x better.  The tofu soup was bland and was spiced with chopped jalapenos instead of traditional Korean spices.  Chodang and Hordori makes the best tofu soup in the valley...I guess I won't be coming back here for Korean food anytime soon.
a4l5DquJhAPeEH0vpWoBWQ,eUIuiO9wiap0X_Nc0O6P2g,FrOCd4DMlWvdaDrk_ojPCA,2.0,Bland.  Bland salsa.  Bland food.  Food came quickly; waitress did not return to the table until we were done.  I had to get up and find someone to refill my glass.  My wife's chicken nachos had no onions; peppers; or cilantro.  The meat in my burrito and enchilada had a grainy texture.  The taste was not horrible; just bland. I have no reason to return.
2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ,s-mcOx2OQWI924rx8h4Y6Q,uwABqaHk9pK-SZFUmTYhZQ,5.0,The most AMAZING buffet I've ever been to! I don't usually like them because I never eat enough for it to be worth it. That was not the case here! We went at 10:30 and we were able to have breakfast and lunch! They also offered endless pours of mimosas and sparkling wine amongst other drinks. I will stay at this hotel next time!!!!
ByFMv3p5X1aNeZhU61rDcA,LSGpMfXySAomK9v5I2_e6Q,VCHAfKyybLpGQvPxBzBDPw,1.0,If you are thinking about staying at stratosphere DONT!!!! Please just do not ; fuck this place . The room is fucking unbelievably terrible!  first thing I notice was the smell ; didn't smell clean . It's also plain and OH MY GOD there is a BANDAID on the smoke detector !! Wtf !  and it's dusty asfuck . Keep in mind I have my 4month year old baby with me and we're here for two nights . Maid service never showed up ; the bathroom smells like straight up shit and the smell will not go away . The shower head sucks ass ; the floors are filthy . There's  writings on the wall . OHH ; THERES BOOGERS ON THE WALL ! FUCKING BOOGERS . I also got rash because I'm sure there are bed bugs ; they definitely don't wash their sheets ; if you have problems ask for a better room .So I complained and they sad they would take one night off of the stupid 80$ fee we did not even use . This place is trash ; read all the other reviews .

sf3kp0H13jZYEmS1A8Etcw,KLYgDnsQcZeIGPrTEFI6uQ,iKwY_mxmmSW8WT88Z383TA,4.0,Inviting and comfortable eclectic faux-industrial-deco decor provides the backdrop for this wine bar and small plates venue.  ..A very approachable and varied wine menu; we started our visit with a big bold Earthquake Petite Sirah recommended by our great server; Joey and then on to some fantastic tapas selections she encouraged us to try...We had Mary's Fried Chicken; Grilled Cheese with Triple Crème Brie; Local Honey; Walnuts & Brioche; 5 Onion Soup with Gruyere & Miche Crouton; and Gnocchi Gratin Bacon; Chives.  All exceptionally tasty; well prepared and presented; even down to the small details of the homemade pickles...I think Tivoli Village has finally found its much needed local treasure and if it wasn't for all the 70's Billy Joel music I would have given this place a 5.
UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA,-BIu4Nq0TLuxkhdjwCZIrQ,p_INAgz9hMxDaJzJcJkHww,4.0,I was here year's ago and it was... forgettable. Is it the same name and owners? I went back a couple days ago and it's really good now! Great food; great price; and a real nice ambiance. I'll be back here often; for sure!
NdPbp-3uQKGnOpPo3s2Y8g,pvwEROiu2kfTqyp6cG2HIA,tmRtq06I3KUn8PwQeLT1iQ,2.0,I was really hoping to try this place and give it a 5 stars but I don't think I will be able to do that. ..The service was good and the atmosphere and interior was great. I had the Peri-Peri poutine. I was hoping for something that was flavorful and for some reason I thought it would be chunks of crispy chicken but it was the chicken breast. It tasted kind of earthy and it was actually a kind of mildly warm in contrast to the hot fries and gravy. I guess it's pieces of chicken they have in the freezer and they warm it up separately and then throw it in the poutine... In addition the chunks of cheese did not melt as it would with Harvey's poutine.  Actually while eating this poutine I wanted to head over to Harvey's next door but I didn't at the risk of being a complete fatty.....Update:  I also have the chicken tenders and it tasted bad. I think it's the way they season their meat. Not a very good seasoning combination. I wouldn't recommend it...To be honest Popeyes is the Bar for a fried chicken shop these days.

YlwJYpBWa-oL0byTVPNKRQ,pD__dFQuypMFLNUibxY0oQ,Yaln3vKBsHSN4FxZRb5g6g,2.0,Interesting concept worth checking out. Over complicated with ordering and the pour your own beer is cool if the kegs are not pouring foam. You end up paying full price for half a beer. Luckily our server got us a beer from the bar free of charge. Was expecting more of a laid back feel; but it's basically your standard sports bar.

30PeUfYV_Jd4jcQNQxfTKA,oGQnKOBNrwERM-MLLfpyGA,_o8qGV_wYlLL5C279Huvng,3.0,A great example of why at least a couple of visits to a GOOD Restaurant are needed before making a final judgment...Remembering that I Go For The Pho; so on my first visit in late June I ranked it to myself as PHABULOUS PHO at half price no less ($3.50 for big bowl!)! I found the Broth was scrumptious but it lacked enough meat to challenge my favorites; but otherwise EXCELLENT! Unfortunately; I found the Spring Rolls to be gummy and NOT very tasty at all. ..Unfortunately; on two subsequent visits; I found the Pho to be less than Phabulous; as it had become quite diluted and NOT nearly worthy of my previous lofty ranking. Could it be the dreaded New Chef In The Kitchen Syndrome; or maybe just a de-emphasis on Pho because of their new half price Pho policy? I believe it might be the former; as I retried the Springrolls and they were different and better than before. Regardless; NOT worth another visit by me; unfortunately!
RtUvSWO_UZ8V3Wpj0n077w,KiQ4lhrQ3nygiINZkG62dw,mdVBnbE4f6hM2ZTVKIa-sQ,4.0,This place is definitely a must visit and certainly unique outside of Japan. The atmosphere and loudness of the staff is a bit over-exaggerated I would say; but it is definitely a fun environment. The staff really give their best effort into creating a fun and vibrant energy; and it may be a bit much for some. I love the decor of the place...Now onto the food. My visit was a while back so I don't exactly remember which specific foods we ordered; but everything was fantastic. The drinks were good as well; but a bit different. I believe the cassis orange was actual squeezed orange with soda; not what I expect but different and good...The servers seemed kind but a lot of them seemed rushed and were running around like mad; which doesn't really feel like attentive service. They kind of assume everyone there doesn't have a clue about Japanese cuisine from what I gathered. The server also scoffed when I asked if they can do a beer with cassis; something I ordered in Japan.

It is large and rambling but still manages to feel intimate. The wine list is extensive and pretty good and the waitress was very friendly and accommodating. The bison meat loaf was really neat; and the rainbow carrots really made it feel special. I had the tenderloin which was perfectly cooked to medium rare. We had a great time. Would definitely go here again!
rZDi46tdwQoSAmxU50xiQQ,r5ggPC6OccLk6dDl5yqsJQ,d3mHFnIQur6n6poyF9Djvw,2.0,When I first arrived to Santa Fe Station; North of the city of Las Vegas; there was a very large valet parking area right in front of the hotel. After schlepping my bags through the entire casino from the self parking garage; you need to valet your car if you're staying at the hotel. The casino looks very modern along with the restaurants and buffet. However; the restaurants closer to the hotel part of Santa Fe look somewhat older; except for the Starbucks; which was probably added during the casino renovation. The nightclub venue; which at the time of this review is called Revolver; is a country styled dance saloon. They do play modern music; Rock; rap and R&B; which is good for variety...I stayed on a Thursday night on the fourth floor. Before going out to the club that night; I went to my room to store my luggage and I had seen a cash register near the elevator. This seemed curious; but I didn't think anything of it; that was a mistake. After returning from Revolver at 2 am; the register was a small part of an entire party that was happening on the fourth floor. Apparently; that register is there to sell drinks to people who visit the fourth floor. The entire floor was turned into party central. After about 4:30 am; I had to go to sleep and the music was still very loud; even through the walls from the other rooms. I did see security walk past my room at one point; but they did nothing about the volume level. The bathroom inside of the room is a little deceiving. The sink fixtures and granite counter top area is nice; but everything else is what you would typically find at any 2 1/2 to 3 star hotel. The toilet was smaller than the average track home install and the tub had nice tiles; but was super slippery; which might be an issue unique to the room. The main door to the room didn't have a secondary lock; which I felt was necessary. The TV's are still the older tube model and the TV stand wasn't level; so the doors kept swinging shut; kinda annoying. The beds were comfortable and better than most hotels; which makes up for a lot...There is WiFi in the room but it is not free. There is no WiFi at the Starbucks. The AT&T and T-Mobile cellular signal was excellent at full 3G bars for each; even inside of the room and nightclub venue...Overall; because of the beds and since I had a good time at Revolver; this might be a good place to stay; if you want to party all night long. If you're just at the location to gamble; the only other place this nice is probably Red Rock Station in Summerlin. The nightclub entry and hotel stay were complimentary and in no way were in trade for a review.
iIwKW2cBAxjElE8eUzjwqA,8ySSDgfLDU6ONV2teATd5Q,5ZTbxdjoypLAF2kJLeSQoA,3.0,Burger tasted burned and server told us that we had to make the order to go (the server said it was because they closed in 15-20 minutes and they were cleaning). They should have a new sign with working hours depicting to-go orders after a certain time.
qSP6RqBJUyJRsQKTarlo6g,HrzGWmRwHZ1NS2BPShuAbA,o40B-P-avI_1lZZNuTZd3Q,5.0,So I stumbled upon this little beauty of a hotel while I was on the hunt for a room for the first night of our long Vegas weekend....And let me say this.....If we hadn't have already booked rooms elsewhere for the other three nights we were there I wouldn't have left the Artisan...The best things about the place are:..Every single member of the staff that I dealt with was very; very courteous; friendly; and helpful. I'm talking from the Valet; to the Doorman; to the Front Desk; everyone was fantastic...This place is BEAUTIFUL. The paintings; the furniture; the design of the place... it took my breath away. It's an incredible mix of Gothic and impressionist renaissance art and design. From the statues that I wanted to take home; to the ornate black fountain in the lobby; to the wall to ceiling (yes literally; on the ceiling) art that ranged from Monet; to Dali; to Picasso; to Degas; to Van Gogh; to the wrought iron doors and wooden carvings; my inner goth girl was in heaven. Even the chapel made me wish I was getting married again just so I could use it. I have so many pictures I took of this place that it's unreal. It's really a sight to behold...The rooms are all themed to a certain artist. We happened to get Room 219 which is a Salvador Dali room. It was gorgeous and super clean. Paintings everywhere; mirrors; a black ceiling fan; ice cold air conditioning; and wall to wall black tile bathroom were awesome. It even had an ornate wooden desk to be able to sit at; as well as a plush black velvet chair you could sink into. ..Also; I was on the second floor while they had the pounding music at the bar underneath and I barely heard a thing. I don't know if people are just being too sensitive or what; but I slept like a baby. Btw; the beds are super comfy and the linens are plush and bright white. ..Seriously; I've been to MANY hotels; including the ones I stayed at the rest of my trip and NONE of them will top my experience at the Artisan. I can't recommend it enough. I've already told everyone I know about it. I will never stay anywhere else when I'm in Vegas. It will always be the Artisan from now on.
AV6weBrZFFBfRGCbcRGO4g,VspYKWl6zVM4zQL9DWLqxA,RrTIVVE3DZUwSn8BBmhIyQ,4.0,We got comp rooms from MY VEGAS; checked in on a Friday; got great rooms on the 12 floor; close to the elevator; ice machine and closest to the parking structure.  The room is a bit larger than the normal rooms at LV but the window is at an angle to follow the pyramid.  Bathrooms decent size.  Well kept for a older hotel. They charge a resort fee of $28./nightly.  Perfect location for the Chris Angel show.  The elevators were something to be desired; shakes because it's old and not in a normal elevator shaft; it goes up the pyramid at an angle.  Love the walkway to the Mandalay Bay shops that connect to the casino too.. although we were as close to the parking structure; it was still a walk to get to your car; Parking can get tight on the weekends.  you may have to show your room key to the security to park in the structure on weekends.

uanCi4OGc1mHLGl_AT4JhQ,j_iLZDEhR0L0Z1tkKhXmHA,YqLUGKtfgNXR7OsNMv-WAw,1.0,Okay; I take back my review. I had a couple days booked and due to a pet emergency was not able to keep my reservation. I understood that I would bot be able to get a refund but I was hoping they would extend some sort of partial credit being as that we were regulars at this hotel. NOPE! NADA! ..I guess I shouldn't be surprised as it is only a one star type of hotel...stash your things and party at a nicer hotel type of place.

dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,8JBNuUAvojqSfWfF-kNPCQ,mrIoKXIcC311O-UG9WijFg,2,I was seated at the bar and had two beers; a White and an Amber; which were pretty good.  However; both times when my beers were done the bartender Sandy walked right in front of me probably six or eight times without asking if I wanted a refill.  And it wasn't that busy.  She was just going back and forth talking to people she seemed to know.  ..Mainly because of that annoyance I left after the two beers.  I feel like a bartender should at minimum monitor for clearly obvious empty glasses; especially when its right in front of them.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,hcJRBNJcf9vfxMDTgdRkSw,4t9JPluBbuq8BlCNnfevFQ,4,Bon service; bonne nourriture; bonne bière à bon prix..Essayez la bière du mois et de la saison!

Great beer selection according to my group and decently priced. I tried their traditional poutine and was a  bit disappointed; but their burgers were pretty good.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,F1CxK5sx7Wp1Zi3qgPjHUQ,N_FnVxM7alOEUby2iNGGEA,3,Les 3 Brasseurs is a chain spot that I wasn't familiar with until I was with 7 other hungry people on a Saturday night and we needed a place that would still have a kitchen open. Luckily; Les 3 Brasseurs was able to host us and offer a great range of menu items at a late hour. ..Since this is mostly a beer place - they make their own range of on tap brews - the wine list was sort of meh. No biggie - I wasn't planning on drinking many glasses; anyway. ..Food was fine; I had the *new* steak and goat cheese salad; and it was pretty satisfactory. The steak could have been warmer and the quantity of goat cheese overpowered most of the salad. ..Service was fine; they were quite busy; and still managed to get us our orders fairly efficiently. I don't know that I'd come back again; only because I know there are so many more options within the downtown core of Montreal!
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,7VvxCDLau8g8ynrQTU8VHg,-1LgUwIBpJzqOYxa_81SAQ,4,We didn't realize this was a chain until we were well into our great time. That's a huge compliment. We'd wandered in from Musée des Beaux-Arts for some appetizers. We ended up having the mushroom Flammekueches and the macaroni and cheese grilled cheese. Both were good. My sweetheart liked them more than I did...  I'm not such a big fan of the thin crust/dry and crispy stuff. The flavors were good; but I felt like both dishes needed some more sauce. The macaroni and cheese grilled cheese sandwich could be amazing; if they'd actually do grilled cheese. It was essentially a serving of baked mac n cheese served between 2 slices of dry toast. There wasn't any cheese melted onto the bread. .We were enjoying ourselves though; so we had a couple beverages. I enjoyed their blonde brew quite a lot. My sweetheart had the Rasp-beer-y lemonade (I tried the strawberry version). Really good; all around. .Good food; nice atmosphere; great service  ( Leo!).  I'd go again.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,61AymMi8D4RTQ2aa1w41ew,6tJjpaqIoFWuUT0RX_y44w,4,Just came here for a drink and an appy at the bar in front of the big screen.  Had the dark brown beer which was tasty at this microbrewery.  My waiter Gabriel realized my French needed help and offered to speak English; he was kind and attentive to all the clients.  The bar was busy.  The food was decent and the key is the beer; big surprise; non?
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,tDZZ2WAPzJui4o8g1DWQjA,JmjUzh8mBESHr0Ls2QyzQQ,4,I love this German/Alsace style bistro. When I was studying in Reims; France; I often went to 3 brasseurs with friends. I was super surprised when I see this restaurant here!! The menu is slightly different. But flammkuchens are still there!!! I like this thin pizza!! And beer is good!!
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,kjOL_OQneDXEAUeOhMUvcw,cTQo54KGP_iBsFq5tbFYHg,3,Beer is good but food depends on the branch. I think st Catherine ones are better than the old port branch at all.

dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,fpYMYJowa9Levq6SszNcvA,hc_CdTU5hGS39TJbGVSGmg,2,i had the $8 pint called the latino it was so bitter I had to hold my breath to swallow it all; by then we went back to rue crescent for some more bar hopping and cheaper tastier beer. once the waiter saw we werent ordering food she literally came and gave us the check without asking if we wanted more drinks which by the looks of our faces was an obvious NO anyways. I say that the on site brewing machines are the highlight of the tourist trap experience here
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,twJoj44dnRLig6up10zntA,TgsPpUeWXmZTesx4UZV5Dw,4,Really good beers here! If you love beer; the beer is fresh; brewed at the location and they have a couple of flavors to choose from.  The food is pretty good too.  Recommend their Pizza.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,haxmVAS6BoN853a6yx2y3A,yBxTnPvlvyI5mQlsmPB_IA,5,Loved this place! Our bartender looked like Leelee Sobieski and was really chill and attentive. All the bar staff and most of the servers were really friendly too; with the exception of this one kinda short chick with dark brown hair who had a surly attitude. ..Even one of the bar-backs recoiled when he saw how nastily she responded when I simply asked if the glass she was holding was a growler. She looked at me and was like; What? So I repeated the question. Then she said; I don't know; it's a glass; then stormed off. The bar-back and I exchanged glances; like; Damn; you mad bro?..Came back another night and was served by a very pretty; friendly girl with glasses and red lipstick. ..Anyway; overall experience was really good. It's too bad we had already eaten both times before coming here because I would have loved to try the food. Next time :)..P.S. Get a beer flight (or two); you won't regret it.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,Isn6_7OsYTZMszsQ-wEJBQ,gi2gEeZrZm6oDmQrx37psQ,3,Les 3 Brasseurs; I spent most of time at the university at this place with some friends. It was definitively our student hangout place; so there's a lot of memory in this place for me; my first beer at 10 am.. :)..Now on with the actual review; Trois Brasseurs is known to brew their own beer. The beer is actually good as an introduction to non-industrial beer but as soon as your taste in beer develop it becomes generic; however generic doesn't mean not good. Their amber beer is the one I get when I go there and definitively their British beer cocktail tastes great and pack quite a punch. It is possible to order a meter of beer which is about 8 (I think not sure) half-pint and it comes with a free lunch...For the actual food; you will eat fine at this place; it will not be the greatest meal you have experienced; but for the atmosphere there is at this place it's definitively worth it. If I compare with the 3 brasseurs I went to in Reims; the food is less good than the one in France but the menu aren't the same at all. I suggest you go with a burger or flamkueche. Last time I tried the 3 Brasseurs Poutine; it was really good however; I think I gain 3 lbs after eating this it contains a lot of thing and fat (and that was expected; I'm not ordering poutine for their healthy value ;) )...The Atmosphere is like the one in a sport bar; so it's a great place to go with a group of friend during the evening/night you will definitively have a good time there; it doesn't get too noisy so you will be able to hear everyone speak without yelling. For lunch it's quite a nice place also their lunch menu doesn't cost a lot and is quite decent.

dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,K95X5oE2-fuDZHhzFOfPUw,dW1_mdwXLKL0VSdA0DPmcw,1,Last night my husband; my friend and myself decided to go have drinks and dinner on the terrasse at 3 brasseurs as we were already downtown shopping. We were sat at a table for four with three chairs. When our other friend texted me to say he would come join us I didn't think it would be a problem since we were sitting at a big table. Well when he arrived; the wait staff refused to get him a chair. They said there were none left on the terrasse and they couldn't possibly take a chair from inside and bring it outside...leaving him standing there awkwardly. We couldn't believe it! How could a restaurant refuse a chair to a potentially paying customer when there's lots of space? It doesn't make any sense. I use to be a hostess many years ago and let me tell you; if a client needed a chair; I would get them a chair. Also the staff didn't seem to care that our friend had to stand. They went and got the manager and he did nothing. So I sat on my husband's lap. Then our waiter disappeared for like half an hour without taking my friend's order. ..Also; the PEI mussels were not fresh.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,u40bEVvk4ioYFKpkX25w8g,6DTIIN8RKQDF8KSPgMoPsQ,4,Good food (especially the soup!); decent service and very charming ambiance! I went there several times over the course of a week and almost all of them were a good trip..Once; while they were busy; the waiter forgot about me; but he was so apologetic about it and really tried to make up for it; that I didn't mind.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,L-GYHQB4fPtC43d4pHxsqw,6F1M2yUP-rZ0yaV4d5chgg,1,Worst service in Montreal. We had a reservation for a party of 40 for over a month and they were not prepared to accommodate a party nearly this size. After two hours they had not served our food and said it would not be coming soon. The servers were incredibly rude and told us it was unreasonable to think we would receive our food by 9:00 when we arrived at 7:00. And the sangria sucked.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,8_A_OdF_OS_PHHyDE2GiZw,AATcmcKCrGt3QBdpIAwVoA,1,UPDATE **** We gave it another try!..My friend and I gave it another tried with a different waiter last wednesday; We tried to seat outside but we've been told that one section was closed. no problem we sit on the other side and order drinks. after 5 min the section we wanted to go to open... Classic! ..But we are fine its really not a problem. The plate we ordered was the one with fried everything wish was tasteless. Maybe I just dont know what to order at this place at all. oignons rings was the best part sadly we left most of the food the waiter never ask us if it was good or not (he probably knows it's not!) And we had to make effort to stop him to have a second drink..........At the end they started closing the section we were in (But the one we wanted to go earlier was now full...) and both felt uncomfortable and rushed ; the waiter asked us to pay in advance because he wanted to save time when closing or something (we saw that coming) Very unprofessional again. .So this is with a I don't care about you anymore and rushed attitude that we ended the night..I think it is fair I gave this place another chance. Will go to mikes next time when I have a craving and want a drink..I don't believe this place will get better....-------------------------------------------------.First Review..1. Took way too long to be seated in a half empty restaurant at 11pm at night. Ridiculous.2. Our waitress had to ask our order 3 times! The second time while taking our order she left to take another table of 6 people order WTF and came back to take our 2 orders.... again for the 3rd time....3. after asking 3 times for the green salad I of course got the ceasar salad which I had to ask the busboy to replace right away.4. Busboy comes back with my salad and ARGUE that I must have had order ceasar because it's on my bill and he's not considering a second that their waitress is really not good at her job (to say it nicely) and at this point im just loosing it. i take a mouth full of wine and just don't even bother to reply to that.....5. my mac and cheese grill chesse that cost around 14$ Not included taxes and tip.... Is the saddest sandwich I ever got. The cook should know what mac and cheese is! Macaroni and 2 slices of kraft dinner cheddar cheese is not what I expect at a restaurant. I do Real mac n cheese at my place; I do not need to spend money on that... I should not get that is this an insult To put 5 tablespoon full of macaroni for the sandwish is a joke...I ate half of my sandwish can you imagine how tasteless it was... picture it. macaroni with NO cheese on it; With toast with slices of cheese on it...Ive never had an issue with 3 brasseurs. obviously the boss there have given up on food and on proper staff training.

I sat at the bar and ordered an IPA. Very friendly bartenders. (The IPA was OK; but it seemed more like a pale ale hops-wise)..The menu isn't huge; but it has decent variety. I ordered a flatbread. (Flamm on the menu) Sausage; peppers; and olives. It came out quickly and very hot. Good flavor; nice crispy crust; and not too heavy...There are a lot of places to eat in Montreal; but if you want a quick beer and a bite at decent prices; check one of these places out.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,PA1HsEu0sRjUwk2ha8_w7Q,GdN8h9jG4FSnIVYdu_ms4g,5,This review is long overdue....but better late than never; right??..I hosted two corporate networking events at this 3 Brewers location (one in November 2015 and the other in April 2017). Both were a huge success; and a big part of that goes to the staff.. .The first event was for 30 people and the second for 50+. For our 2015 event we reserved a portion of the upstairs space and had a dedicated server for our group who was fast; efficient and friendly. That server was Alex. After a great experience; we made a point to bring our group back again the next time we were in Montreal. So in 2017 we went back to host a similar (but bigger) event.  Imagine my surprise to see Alex there again...this time as manager. He remembered our group; and was as attentive as ever. He dedicated his staff to take care of us; but he personally made sure that everything was to our satisfaction. We had drink tickets for our guests; and he made sure that we had hot food coming out in waves all night long...It's not often that you receive such great service - especially as a large group. But the staff at 3 Brewers (Crescent location) continue to amaze us. ..Thank you Alex for your attention to detail; your professionalism and for making us feel special on two separate occasions. We will definitely be back!
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,PVOtG_2eJOnJLoLmT_rQig,lT4P8PADG5KcoMlb023VlQ,3,Ok drinks; decent food; but nothing spectacular....don't get the salmon tartare (very bland and dry). Service is meager.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,CBcVLRQBySr3IdjLB5jOwA,M7wpFVpAaxQE1H8piwerPQ,4,OMG! They have my size - the demi; which in Canadian terms is half a pint. I'm liking Canada already - just need a visa and I'm home. ;)..This is a low-key restaurant with friendly staff. The music volume was just right - not too loud so I could have a great late night conversation with my girlfriends. ..Note: You will discover in Canada (if you haven't already) that they offer separate checks and give you your change right then and there. Amazing. It saves a lot of brain power for people dining in groups.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,9VTnBgZHB-22c6OmLmEk-w,NfPr1d7pBvRC6ZjTbulzvQ,5,We were walking down Crescent Street looking for a place to eat. Past the cute salad place; would have gone to Burger Bar bit too busy and noisy; I wanted to go to Hooters but my teen age daughter said no way that's gross. Then at St. Catherine I saw the bright lights of Les 3 Brasseurs and I realized this is the place that advertises on all the tourist books. So what the hell. The menu looked good and the prices very fair. Walked in about 8:30; hot a great high table/booth. Waitress was good; has a flight of beer samplers. Ordered a burger and chicken with waffle sandwich with salads. Very good. The highlight was Jerry their in house beer sommelier. Jerry was very polite; asked about our beer and made suggestions.  Later he came back and offered to give us a tour of their beer brewing facilities. Very informative and a great explanation of the beer making process. Bottom line; we'll be back!  Highly recommended for the food; beer; and great atmosphere and Jerry's tour!
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,LhjJpe07vjKaRyZYKJKGRQ,dixtaOFhVFHu6o2RqTDLaA,4,They have kids menu. I went there with my two kids. We can take a seat inside at lunch time. My son enjoyed his crispy chicken tender and grilled mash mellow with cracked for his dessert.(include kids menu). I had two glasses of beer. One is raspberry;  the other is white beer. I prefer to white beer. They have lunch special. I ordered fritas. Very good on beer. Service and food were not very good but we had good time in there.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,HNaWGdHGWofXDAKtYgGPnQ,xJlX9F0J_afu2PYK-odNug,2,I came for a burger; but didn't realized that beer burgers taste different from regular burgers; and that I don't like them.  It was pretty loud - which can be fun - but we had a hard time hearing our waiter - and his French was better than his English and we didn't speak any French. I think it would have been more fun if we went with a group of people; drank; and spoke French.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,SVC0CajvmYfH5uAq4JnGvg,lwsZpIucI6be1L1vVtdATQ,4,Service and atmosphere were awesome! Pub based rating. .Opted for the poutine flam and the chicken and waffle dish; both were yummy and a 'fat kid special' but we felt like beer and carbs apparently! .I feel like if I lived in Montreal it would easily become a watering hole to meet friends for a drink or two. .Wish I could remember our servers name; she was an absolute sweetheart. She actually went around to all the staff asking for restaurants recommendations for us.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,WFkgsoSYx25QQRKQfpvGCg,Y4NfQlGKJLRaukQAMeTNAQ,2,Très bon service. Excellente sangria blanche ou rouge. Juste à côté de nous le gérant a engueulé une serveuse à deux reprises; juste à côté du bar. Vraiment un manque de professionnalisme et de savoir-vivre. Monsieur le gérant; il y a certainement un endroit discret pour discipliner vos employés.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,oRtFHQya_MgpWjlLIRjM1w,GAbf6JTqEU6rvlX5GLiglA,4,Certains soutiendront que Les 3 Brasseurs ne méritent pas les quatre étoiles que je leur attribue. Cependant; elles reflètent le niveau de satisfaction que j'éprouve chaque fois que je fréquente cette brasserie. D'abord; éliminons le sujet de la bière; qui est brassée sur place. Si on cherche à découvrir de nouvelles saveurs; on n'est pas au bon endroit; puisque les quelques bières proposées par l'établissement sont très peu originales; quoique bien faites; et se comparent à celles produites par les grands brasseurs industriels. Tout au plus leurs bières sont elles légèrement plus maltées que ces dernières. Cependant; la bière y est très abordable; notamment lorsqu'on commande des pichets. Quant à moi; mon format préféré est Le Varlet; soit un litre de bière servi dans un énorme bock. ..Côté nourriture; je ne recommande pas les hamburgers des 3 Brasseurs; qui sont plutôt ordinaires. Par ailleurs; La choucroute 3 Brasseurs est merveilleuse et; bien entendu; accompagne à merveille la broue simple mais honnête de l'établissement. Et si vous avez encore faim; ce qui serait surprenant; les cacahuètes sont gratuites en tout temps !
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,pwu9Gaf-K1edkxNr8FSLOg,wyGSx11bX8DlkEmmYffQaQ,1,Avoid.  .We had one of the worst servers ever.  .may I reccomend a steak for sir ? and perhaps a salad for the lady ?!?!.We gave him cash for our cheque and when I handed it to him; he asked how much change would you like ? The cheek!.Beers were tasty. Food was average.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,AM3SSYqgob97Q6MBw22Y-g,0oz2GiBcSaH5M2qQnxQ0Lg,3,The raspberry lemonade cocktail with white ale was tasty. This is a spacious bar. Good for group of people. They have TVs everywhere. It is loud like other bars.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,UTLlKYiBIrradO7Kr0aMSw,gCANd6GLzYl0fz61N9JxCw,5,The pork shank was soooooooo delicious! Juicy! Yummy! And it's a big plate which offers you two shanks. I think it's better to share with another one..And the tomato sauce mussel was also very good taste. And for drink; the strawberry + rum was the best choice for me!!!
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,-uglef88WEwkI6UlAqwO0Q,_4AbgU6klxkbCMBa-gIcpg,4,My wife and I entered here to try the happy hour and grab some dinner. We were seated at a high table with great views of all the awesome TVs lining the walls. Our waitress switched to English; no problem; and she was very good...During happy hour they offer their blonde and amber for a good price. The amber was pretty nice; a balance of hops and malt that was very pleasing to the palate. The blonde was refreshing and was delicate...I ordered the chicken southwestern salad. Super yummy. Lots of chicken that was leaking tenderness. My wife had the Caesar and she was happy as well. It came with dressing at first; but our waitress turned it around in about 5 minutes to make my wife happy; dressing on the side. Very impressive. She really was looking to make our experience good...I always say; with social media today; for 5 bucks; I would try to make every customer as happy as possible. A review on Yelp tells me where to go in new cities. If I could pay $5 to get 4 or 5 stars instead of 1 or 2 for bad service; I would take the hit any day. People pay hundreds of dollars for advertising; but $5 here and there is worth its worth in advertising gold. We pretty much ignore any restaurant under 3 1/2 stars...The place was inviting for a touristy brew pub; everyone inside seemed happy. The beer was pretty cheap during happy hour...Mr. Kalenborn was in post 10 mile walking paradise.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,j9r-kzGIxWA_IGy7k8ZQpg,YP22XmmOaEtP0juH1H_ZEw,3,With all they hype of how great this place is suppose to be; I suppose it didn't live up to it.  The beer (I did have their IPA) was good.  I'm not sure if I can say it's the best I ever had; but it's a good IPA...The food itself was decent.  I had their burger; and the bun was different; brioche with a nice crunchy crust and a soft; decent.  But there was a lacking of flavor; seasoning just wasn't quite there.  Not only that; the fries (even though I did order it with the salad which I never got) were almost stale tasting...It's a pretty big bar for Montreal; and if I was just going there to catch a game; and a beer without the food; it might be better.  But seeing as I go up there only once a year; I have other places that are higher on my list of places to go.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,PW50KG6menpoHdKeYLAvTg,RL2pAyh2xLCBYfMp2uPprA,4,Pros: .Service is helpful and efficient and courteous..Food: I really enjoyed my open faced goat cheese sandwich. It was very rich in flavor and a generally all around good dish..Atmosphere: family and friend oriented...Cons:.A bit more expensive than I think it's worth but not too much...Recommendation:.A good place for to meet family and friends for informal occasions. Probably should take a date elsewhere.
dfo-LKRBm40etYpH-Rcsog,nu6b6GpbSMXeQeE-u4sf0A,J2dLAqL0RQdq_wrq5wk_Yg,4,While walking back to our hotel one night we noticed Les 3 Brasseurs which was a very short walk from our hotel. It was at this time we realized this was a local brewery chain as we had dinner at the Les 3 Brasseurs in old Montreal a few nights earlier. We decided to give this location a try because our experience at the other location was very nice...The outdoor seating area here was very crowded and located on a street that reminded me of NYC so we decided to eat inside. We were shown to the upstairs dining room; the space was dark and welcoming. Because we had eaten at their other location we knew that we wanted their dark beer and ordered a pitcher. We also ordered a fresh pretzel with mustard to nosh on. A quick look at the menu and we both ordered steak frites. I ordered mine medium well my wife medium rare. Both were properly prepared and very tasty. It was also a good cut of meat...I we had a Les 3 Brasseurs in our area of NYC we would make it a go to place. But if you find yourself in Montreal you can make it your go to place.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,rtQ5gKz8982aja96EUMooQ,1VwLdBvRun5dg9T6YAOJdA,4,Great traditional polish food. The menu découvert (tasting menu) is great as you will have a bot of everything; their beets soup is delicious ; for the pireogies I like their meet one :)
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,MLt8ij1w1SR1R7UmdyUU6A,8IxD5o_jr5-nQRa7PuPQTQ,4,The food was good ; the young waiter was nice and polite..No wifi in this place and hostess was rude.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,9PS9d3DzJk93eGNZQItmSw,T1ejHmQmVhgpSMiz-8dIUQ,5,We tried this place on a tip from a friend. What a tip!!  The Bloody Pollock was smart and tangy with just the right amount of horseradish.  The Kalabasa was delicious; the sauerkraut was wonderful and the potatoes were potatoes.  Service was spectacular. The ambience was very quaint and the piano player added the crowning touch. Can't wait to return
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,PuZJiOldILOyI7clUiwgWw,fVnqGH9fYuMjtutIKsARbQ,5,We ate here and were very happy. The space is romantic and the service was great. We even had a Polish waiter. I had the stroganoff with potato pancakes and salad. So yummy. My husband had the sausage plate and it was huge. The piano player and the open windows were a delight as it was warm for September. I definitely recommend. We are even considering going again tonight!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,gmqXlAyZxFc2w3cndc13dw,ZYBJ90vAv98sbogVbZ46HQ,4,Absolutely gorgeous cafe in the midst of old Montreal! Service is really quick and efficient with wonderful tasting food. I had the cabbage rolls with pork and rice - it was flavourful - not too strong; not too subtle. Highly recommend
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,YOCixjIuF0hpIu7p5gXdVA,yWWCi6EZ3GvJBjz1CQrllg,4,Very good food and nice atmosphere. The piano player was there and that was a nice touch. The beet soup is amazing. Salty but in a good way. Nice and clean. I had the Charcuterie plate. It was pretty good. The cheese wasn't anything special. I liked the Lard and the meat with prunes in the middle. Finally I finished with two kielbasa. They were amazing; nice and crisp and fresh; not as salty and fake tasting as store bought...Try it out. It was worth sitting at the bar since it was Valentines day and the tables were all booked.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,AXuXeKdcrX06h1Em8eAfMg,sR-p3yPgOlnCmgPwwNLykA,4,I knew when this place was very popular with the locals it had to be good. We go to Montreal every year and don't miss eating dinner here. The wait staff seems like family and that's just how you are treated. At times they have a piano player who adds to the room. Not very large but they have seated large party's in the middle by putting tables together. When you are a party of two they just separate the table of four a little. Last year they actually had a chef grilling outside on the sidewalk. The kitchen is downstairs and service is efficient. Very small bar and I have eaten at the bar when no tables were available. The desserts are in a case next to the bar area; save room even if you normally don't eat dessert. I often take mine home because it's so good. Looking forward to my next visit.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,QydwVCjK9_FLXNucm7fCkA,ZQhGrtUtPFq1_YQrfSGMMg,3,Finally; a Montreal restaurant that I'll actually willingly return to!  ..I've been so disappointed by the Montreal restaurant scene; so I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The borsch soup; though wasn't so good. In fact; it was just a red; salty broth. I was expecting something with texture...I ordered the debutant menu which featured a sampling of perogies; chopped sausage with sauerkraut; a deep-fried thing sorta like an egg roll with beef inside; and a potato pancake (latke?). Very nice. I just wish there was more sausage!..The dessert (apple strudel) was just okay and not at all like the strudels I've had elsewhere. A strudel should have layers; no? This one was more like an apple crumble - a soggy one at that. And the taste was nothing special. Next time; I'll just order a la carte and get a main dish without entree or dessert. ..In terms of value; I think it's overpriced for what you get; though. But since this is one of the few Montreal restaurants where I wasn't disappointed; I'll give this place 3 stars.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,plOtZruZJ-rxF7VCgeS40A,dxINBUn7vShn8Vysd3RHXA,5,This place is fantastic. Cool setting; live piano music; great Polish food. The zurek was great (and something I hadn't tried before); borscht was good; pierogies were (as expected) excellent.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,AF7HUYYtB3jovSdZrdqfig,Q5iCCjzwIkLCK_nG1TMnPg,5,Splendid - that's how I'd describe it. I'm a Pole; born and raised in Poland; spend there good 25 years of my life (out of 32; so I guess it counts for something). I visited Stash Cafe Bazaar with my parents; born; raised all-time Poles and a few friends and we were all nothing but impressed. Ordered barszcz; zurek (soups); krokiet with mushrooms (started); all of their dumplings and kotlets - all of which was splendid. Soups were nice and flavorful and tasted home-made; krokiet was delicate; not greasy; subtly mushroomy; all of the dumplings tasted awesome (meat ones would be my favorite) kotlets were huge and tasty. Only complain was from my dad; who wanted more of their side potatoes - he's one big starch-loving traditionalist) and from me to increase their Polish beers selection (although they had some nice local beers; so that's just my wishful thinking). Decor was very nice too; ambiance was great; live music added on to that. Prices were very reasonable too. Overall an afternoon at Stash Cafe Bazaar was the best ending to our Montreal trip - thank you for that! Best Polish food I had outside Poland for sure (except my own cooking that is ;)))
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,IcMBRRt0gMbDhi4I_hvgLA,hH5qgSCR_ybTC6jQtw6fYQ,5,Food was fabulous and so is the service! Pierogies were better than I excepted. My waiter was great and was quick at serving us. The seat by the open window really made the whole experience really good. Would come here again.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,3vmpOB2O_AWAhXRqf2kgow,8y4v20Eh3rOSt_ORCh03zQ,5,This was a great find; just on my stroll through Old Montreal when my wife had to use the rest room so we decided to stop to have some food and drinks; the pierogis were great and the drinks were on point!.Nice cozy joint with a great atmosphere; would be happy to stop by this place again when in Montreal.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,F_q99_Tp-nAggytgMX9O4Q,CByCdY6nQXSuHrzRiLS2Gg,5,Great food and great service. Visited on a trip to Montreal with family. Kids loved the food as well. Highlight was the live music by an great pianist. Very comfortable place for a great family dinner.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,Yx8RqQSI8cO4jfW7VKw4Kw,L5I17c8oYPONKob6X-oHng,4,After walking around Old Montreal for a good half hour indecisively looking at menus; Stash Café finally looked like it would be the spot. We walked into a dimly red lit; cozy restaurant with a smell that made my mouth water. Despite not having reservations; we were seated immediately at a nice table by the front windows...We started off with some Kielbasa for an appetizer - probably one of my favorite types of sausage; and it didn't disappoint. Perfectly sautéed with tasty onions. For the main; we both settled on the Strogonow - strips of perfectly cooked beef filet in a red wine sauce with mushrooms; plus a bonus two small potato pancakes and a beet salad. The beef was flavorful and satisfying; and the potato pancakes were among the best I've ever had. Stash Café for a great Polish meal? You can't beat it.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,DY95NdqXaLqdaNM0qIHCpw,Q70zRP0Y8RtbyEk7PZHzEA,4,(see explanation of ratings below)...4 of 4 stars (excellent; casual dining)...Love it.  Good Polish food in a cozy atmosphere...They don't have the dozens of vodkas as they did years ago; so that was a disappointment...Love the pickled herring...About $30 per person for lunch; no dessert; booze included; gratuity excluded....About my ratings:..Only high-priced dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place; I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food; it would be a different story.  But; as we know; yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience...Therefore; I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):..1) fast food and fast-casual; low-priced (no table service)...2) casual; mid-priced dining (table service; average entrée price: $10-$20)...3) fine; high-priced dining (linen napkins; no plastic cups; no TV's in dining room; average entrée priced at more than $20; can vary depending on the city)...High-priced dining can earn a max of five stars.  Mid-priced dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,UysqgjSXPmX78B3vyMgqxA,5myeBTxnsv61gHYrdJOqhA,4,They actually had room for all 7 of us with same day reservations!!!! Food was delicious and atmosphere was cozy with nice background music
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,D1Mrl078m1CbctH8nqsshg,GXpCU_67C_8CbCuURNtR-A,5,I came here with four friends for dinner and we had the most amazing meal during our Montreal trip. My meal was so good that I texted three of my family members right after to rave about what I had just eaten...To start off with; Stash Cafe has great service and an even better ambiance. It feels really cozy and warm; which was great since it was downpouring outside that evening. We were seated right away and our water was friendly and attentive. Everything is priced very well--we all got appetizers; wine; and a full meal for around $40 per person. The waiter also gave us our individual checks without us even having to ask; which was awesome...I got the cheese and potato Perogies as an appetizer and the Krokiety with beef as my main meal. The Krokiety came with a side salad and sauerkraut--the salad dressing was to die for; I wish I got the recipe for it from the waiter. Everything I ate was very flavorful and homey. We enjoyed this restaurant so much that we almost came back the next day for another meal...I will be returning to Montreal this summer solely to eat at Stash Cafe again.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,235W87YggWprtBY9jKXQTg,5fkFQPKoP_btkUZ6--mnpQ,4,Great place - agree with the other reviewers. We had Borsch soup and the only thing to comment on was that we thought it should have had some chunks of actual beets.My wife had the Golabki (cabbage rolls) and loved it. I had the Pierogi and found it excellent. That and two glasses of Chopin vodka and St Ambroise beer topped it off. By the way; the piano player was enjoyable. The only sour note was our waitress who either had an attitude or ......The other tables had a waiter who really seemed to go out of his way to please and explain the dishes - wish we had him
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,kiBatsAUF-qKJdoOZkSuYQ,Czi6EhUPc9yRI4PvFhpx7g,5,We stopped here while walking around Old Montreal because a lot of the other restaurants were more expensive. The food was very tasty and arrived quickly; and the staff was very professional and spoke English and French; which was helpful as nobody in my group speaks much French.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,hSNEWH508zv-Ouong3zFqg,i4pDoVRwuEj9KoGvi0Dg0A,4,Found this in Old Montreal.  Started with the cold beet soup served with cucumber and sour cream.  Very refreshing and delicious.  Next came a fried crepe filled with beef.  Amazing!  Next we had a friend pork chop served with sauerkraut and roasted potatoes.  The potatoes were quite good - perfectly done.  I was expecting something different from the pork chop and while good; was not spectacular.  The cabbage rolls filled with ground pork and rice were some of the best I have ever had. The flavor is unique - maybe thyme was the spice.  The atmosphere is vibrant and service friendly and efficient.  There is much more to discover in the menu and I hope to make it back there.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,OVOovTxliDoDZRfMuo61Tg,J62s3JCUPbkRAYOo9jc8yQ,5,First time at a Polish restaurant. Was very surprised. Enjoyed the tasting menu for beginners. Great for groups.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,Go006PCN18nVAAQ8fjHBiA,SGQpGcQtpUU1dHulUSnpCQ,3,Super cute place with decent Polish food. We ordered the borscht ; which was okay; but nothing to write home about. Then we shared some pierogies with apple sauce AND sour cream on the side; because that's how I do it; and those were much better. We ordered some other stuff; but they must have not been that great if I can't remember what they were...The waiters were all very pleasant; if a bit slow during a time when the restaurant wasn't very busy. I would pop in again; but only if I were craving some pierogies and found myself in the area.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,qQN5WDFijhsD--Z3NpEJWQ,VXTDkwswGtMBYaNmu4YP2w,3,On the plus side; Stash Cafe has nice ambiance and excellent service. I loved the piano player. He had a wicked sense of humor and played some very interesting melodies such as David Bowie's Major Tom and lots of old TV themes and hits from the 80s...The food unfortunately was just average. We had their wild boar special and it was a little over cooked with way too much sauce.  Maybe this was an off night for the chef...Will definitely give this place another try when I am back in Montreal. May stick to the simpler polish dishes like pirogi and sausage next time.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,5qIwy91T9rAQj3_2O4cn5g,gR26AgSQIQODW_jRT02gvg,4,Good Polish food in a charming atmosphere...I  dined here a few days ago and to get a feel for the place ordered the 'sampler plate' - the Table d'Hote's Menu du Debutante. For my appetizer I chose the the Sledz - a very tasty 'herring salad' wrapped in a herring filet. For the entree plate itself the Pierogies were the star of the car - plump and tasty and perfect. The Placki (potato pancakes) were delicious as well - though I would have liked a bit of apple sauce to go with the sour cream. On the other hand the Krokiet (croquette) was kind of bland for a fried crepe filled with meat. But most disappointing was the Bigos (cabbage stew with meat and mushrooms) which was oddly flavorless given the ingredients. The Menu du Dubutante comes with a small fruit cobbler but I instead ordered the Hazelnet cake - creamy and nutty and delicious. I paired all this with a St-Ambroise Oatmeal Stout and coffee...If I were to do it again I think I would try the vegetarian version of the Menu du Debutante - getting the mushroom Krokiet and cheese/potato or cabbage/mushroom Pierogies. Or just stick with the Pierogies...As I mentioned the atmosphere is charming and there is a small bar off to one side of the restaurant. As for the service...it was brusque yet efficient and aggressively polite almost to point of rudeness. It took me back to any number of Eastern European restaurants I've visited in the past.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,v0nLst5k8TOUhwFXZhUoUA,PQMTyFN9RaWYuHCu_frMCQ,4,They serve the kind of food you only get in people's homes. It's not fancy restaurant food by any means; just solid stews and such. I keep thinking back to the dishes and how I can recreate them at home...Rich dishes (try the post-hunt pork and cabbage stew). Really friendly service. One of my favorites in Montreal. Surprising to find reasonable and good food in the touristy area.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,7cpXEIjvCdjI_uG7QufHCQ,G-vIhkAqTIimIJZBM5YyWA,5,I'm Polish and my fiancé is Ukrainian.  We were walking around the Old Town for the first time on a trip to Montreal for my birthday and literally stumbled upon it.  We checked the menu and it had all of the great food we grew up with; everything looked great; so we went inside.  To be honest; I was prepared to be disappointed based on my experience visiting Polish restaurants in the United States - but what a very pleasant surprise!  The decorating was a nice mix of old Montreal; dark and light wood; but with an agreeable dash of more modern Polish artwork.  Seating was very comfortable and a nice change from the tiny tables other restaurants have. ..The food... was fantastic. By far; the most authentic and identical to the homemade and dishes I grew up with.  The piergories; the second best I've had compared to my mom's.  The potato pancakes - perfect and served with apple sauce and sour cream.  (These are very hard to do right - they were spot on!)  Not too heavy and not to dry; the right mix of crispy outside and tasty inside.  My fiancé had the fish stew which comes with larger hearty pieces of delicious white fish in a tomato-like stew with vegetables.  This is not my personal favorite; but I liked it...Good selection of Polish beers; vodka and a full bar.  Service was very pleasant; and not slow. The food is definitely made fresh every day and well worth waiting for.  As another reviewer mentioned; even on the first visit - you feel as if you have been here before and already know everyone.  We finished our meal with homemade apple strudel served with a light sour cream sauce.  Price - was very reasonable and the portions are perfect (although you will be tempted to order more to explore the menu deeper!)..One of the most pleasant experiences during our trip to Montreal - not to be missed!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,X1FGKq4X3kmOO3XXBUqxwg,4,Polish colleague of mine brought me to Stash Cafe  years ago and the restaurant was on my list to revisit since then. We were a group of nine and at first we started kind of slowly with the drinks and orders; as soon as our choice was made appetizers and mains started coming quickly; and orderly. ..The food in Stash was perfect for the rainy fall evening; filling; warming and quite delicious. I had the tripe soup; which was amazing; very well seasoned and the tripe was excellently cooked. The two starters we tried were the herring; single piece of fish garnished with apples and sour cream; and the  potato pancakes. The potato cakes were just Ok; but I'm a big fan of the herring. The main courses were perfectly prepared. If you opt for schnitzel you would not regret and it comes with wonderful red beet salad. The star of the dinner with no doubt were the pierogi; there are three flavours to choose from; the meat ones being my favourite. We naturally went with the Polish and Czech beers as a drink choice; but the menu offers good wine list and some vodkas if you'd like to consume your herring appropriately. ..The restaurant has cute atmoshphere; the little benches used for seating may be a little bit uncomfortable if you fit three grown up people in them. However; the good food compensates for it. The live piano performance is wonderful. I can easily see myself coming again for some soup and pierogi; and glass or more of wine.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,8uIEWpa0_du2rEvohvxN1g,eIv9W4hFxL5-abealCzIVg,5,This place is fantastic. Staying in town from California and ate here twice in a week. The service was really friendly. The food was delicious. And there was an old time pianist playing pop songs. It looks like NY mafia place without the kitsch. I recommend.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,c35Pf_lVp8LlWBRqtQJqDg,6BtwXdckZfZBLWh8p2gnQA,4,Not polish; but food was so good we went back again the 2nd night.  Service the first night was very poor.  Waiter said he was having a bad day.  Second night; a different waiter was extraordinary.  The piano music was excellent for quiet dinner and conversation.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,ADdZfjYwqQAFx28wXkbNZw,_2jJmrFLsqJhDUVAMfDmgA,5,Amazing restaurant. I come from a Polish family and really enjoy Polish food; and this place was great. I ordered an option that included a soup appetizer; a large main entree; and a dessert. This was a great way to try many items on the menu. Everything was wonderful- especially the pierogis and kielbasa. The restaurant also had a great drink selection; knowledgeable and friendly staff; and a cozy environment. It was my favorite meal in Montreal. I highly recommend to anyone!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,f_evBImeOZavf8kSiabPtA,vGUad4frTCefS9y2bwOr5A,5,We had the best time there last night. Nice big table for our party right in the middle of the restaurant. Waiter was super efficient and sweet. I had the price fix meal that started with mushroom soup (to die for); mixed sausages and other stuff; perogies were amazing; especially the ones stuffed with spinach. And the plum cobbler for dessert. You had to roll me out. Great food; sweet staff and a fun environment all made for a wonderful meal with friends. Reasonably priced too. I will certainly return.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,0jpDYapKybow2VeWud8nuA,a6dn0E7klbx2x4HLlGAkUg,5,I can't believe it. I've been to this amazing place many times but haven't reviewed it yet! I love this polish cafe. Everything from the late night ambiance with a piano playing in the background to the delicious food that never disappoints. If you're in the area of old Montreal there are a lot of great places to choose from but this place should definitely be high on your list...I would heartily recommend the potato pancakes and the perogies (which flavour? Why not try them all!?). The staff are super friendly and will help you decide with excellent recommendations.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,E5nRF4bClGRgpo9JeCHfqg,UN__MUe-x7w8kuS-ntY2uw,4,Lovely ambience .. the music was little loud for that ambience. I had the potato latkes which was very good. Perogies - my first time to try it! I found it oily. I tried the mix of cheese potato and mushroom perogies. The fried onions on top was nice. Still it's oily for me. However like the place as it's a great memory to me ! Try it :)
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,HEOMmKylwNrPqDTYlYuGFw,2cuxKtDUta_d7G9ZILMZYw,5,Warm and cozy vibe: beautiful artwork hanging from the ceiling: spectacular Ukrainian Borscht; delicious kielbasa sausages with sauerkraut and potatoes; tasty apple cobbler. A hit with every dish.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,Hop3lxxOg-hafA1lo0DUfg,B4kW887WKBJDHWPGvvfwTQ,2,Every thing was great except the filet of sole. It was the dryest piece of fish I have ever had. What was the chef thinking frying it with almonds and nothing else. Yuck. When I complained the staff did nothing - nothing.  I spent 180$ there.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,pRhBKFwm7jKy_G1pwWYfmQ,Z-DofXeCKlbCfRkvKAt0IA,5,This was the Best upscale Polish restaurant I've ever been to! And I live near Hamtramck; MI. The original Polish Town. Ever bit of food that we ate was delicious! Can't say enough good about it!!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,PV0U0arT_AUfjVBtrKfPSA,-p_qXO0vHflIM03fnT2Bow,5,On our first night in Montreal we walked over to Rue Saint-Paul and over to Stash. The restaurant was chosen from the Yelp reviews and it was pretty close to our hotel. Rue St-Paul is an awesome little street with numerous restaurants and shops...I have had Polish food  in Philadelphia but Stash is different. The Polish places I have I been to before were mostly in bars or semi cafeteria style but Stash is a really; really nice place. The space is very old world inside and warm with a wood and stone interior. We were there in June and the windows were open. They had a live piano player that only added to Stash's charm...Everything we had we really great; including the Pierogis. I had the Polish Stroganoff and that was pretty darn incredible. The potato pancakes were the best I have ever tasted. The dessert was also excellent. Our server was great and helped us with our choices. The prices were reasonable...Stash is a great restaurant to try in Old Montreal. It won't disappoint.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,T0suY4tj5jXsbrpGdo2i7A,5,I had heard some wonderful things about this place and was looking forward to trying Polish food for the first time. Instead of taking a menu du debutant; we literally just ordered four main courses that contained the same items as the discovery menu and shared it among four people.  We did replace the plaki with kielbasa and they turned out to be among the best sausages I've ever  had. I really liked trying a bit of everything and I would recommend the same if you don't mind sharing. The price was extremely reasonable too. I would happily return for a casual dinner any night.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,75Xtdm65_xnFXbL3vKSRAA,CYg9Gn42eXal5FH-qQWoOw,5,Yum. We really liked this place. Service was super friendly and fast. The good was delicious. We had the perogies to start; then we shared the breaded pork and the steak in red wine sauce. The potato pancakes were delicious! Some reviews say it is a bit pricey but I thought it was very reasonable.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,BuVjNYAd5Bayj5E3eisX-g,JnhD4nxHdSfrSYlm0bk4vA,5,Le meilleur restaurant Polonais de Montréal; dans une ambiance chaleureuse et tellement typique. Un pianiste accompagne le repas bien copieux et délicieux... Dans la pure tradition Polonaise. Au passage; si vous y allez la première fois; choisissez le menu débutant accompagné d'un vin blanc Hongrois ou d'une bonne bière.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,vNToltF1f4NLPRNHH4DEbg,qkgZqXxDtKJUcyjsq3hIZA,4,Walking around Old Port with my family; we decided to stop here for dinner. Everything was shared family style so I got to try some of everything...Food 5/5: Keeping in mind that this was my first time eating Polish food; everything was delicious! We got the set Debutant menu which came with the soup of the day and dessert. The soup of the day was pickle soup which although sounds weird; was one of my favourite things; completely unique! The dessert was an apple crumble; which was the perfect ending to the meal; not too sweet and with fresh whipped cream. The Debutant main was a mix of their top sellers; which I definitely recommend getting this so you can try different stuff. The placki were like giant hash browns and the pierogis were probably the best I've ever had. We also ordered strogonow and golabki. I loved the beet salad side! We wanted to try the sznycel but they were sold out. Everything was tasty however very heavy and meaty; I was glad we didn't get an extra dish. ..Atmosphere 5/5: The restaurant is quaint; with comfortable bench seating for big groups but dark romantic lighting for dates. It's a versatile space even though the restaurant is quite small. It's quite busy though so I would definitely recommend making reservations...Service 3/5: This is where they lost points. We'd been eating all day so we didn't order a lot for dinner; and most of my family doesn't drink; so I felt like we were a write-off to the waitress. Once she took our orders; I don't think we saw her again until she brought the bill. She didn't come by to check on us or refill water.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,-cRpRWzaQjDYNIUdx76PiQ,ChA3F5t7VP0oUdNd2HwtgQ,4,Excellent Polish food. Delicious borscht and the lightest pierogies I have ever had. The place is small so you may need a reservation.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,NrRHod3FtQPKMjF7WbRD4A,htOyTTDPg1lRK9YmaOJgUg,2,Avant de commencer; je dois dire que je ne connais rien à la cuisine polonaise et que ce restaurant constitue mon premier contact avec cette cuisine. Tout ce que je sais de la cuisine polonaise; c'est qu'elle comporte beaucoup de patates. Allons y maintenant pour la critique...Côté ambiance; ce petit resto est parfait. La déco fait très vieille Europe et l'édifice historique dans lequel il est sis y contribue grandement. Je sais aussi que le soir; on y retrouve un pianiste qui joue de la musique très vivante et que l'endroit est souvent bondé en saison haute...Côté service; c'est là que ça se gâte un peu. Les serveuses sont toutes très gentilles; mais bon Dieu qu'elles sont lentes! La journée où j'y suis allé; c'était un après-midi pas mal calme. Elles étaient trois au bar à ne rien faire et ça leur a pris beaucoup trop longtemps à me remarquer dans l'entrée. Cette lenteur aura été caractéristique de notre repas; l'allongeant bien plus qu'il s'en faut...Côté bouffe; c'était bon; mais sans plus. En fait; je dirais que c'était ordinaire. Sourtout le dessert. Peut-être que c'était de l'excellente cuisine polonaise; je n'en sais rien; mais je ne sais pas si j'y retournerais... Le meilleur plat que j'ai mangé -- surprise totale -- c'était mon entrée : du hareng mariné servi avec des oignons rouges; une salade de pommes râpées et de la crème sûre; ça m'a beaucoup plu. Vint ensuite; un sanglier en daube aux oignons et au vin; avec chou rouge braisé et pommes de terre. Le sanglier était trop cuit pour être un rôti (ce qui était écrit au menu); mais pas assez pour être en daube; donc relativement dur. La sauce était goûteuse; mais très grasse et les patates très fades. Mon élément préféré était le chou; qui acidulé; coupait bien le graisseux du reste de l'assiette. Vint enfin le pire élément du repas : une espèce de croustade aux pêches assez infecte. Le croustillant était mou; dans le genre j'ai plusieurs jours de réfrigération derrière moi et les fruits criaient la conserve. Le seul plus de l'assiette : le tout était noyé de smetana; une crème sûre sucrée. Hélas il n'y en avait pas assez pour masquer complètement le goût désagréable de cette chose. Mon compagnon; pour sa part; avait commandé le barszcz (version polonaise de la soupe aux betteraves ukrainiennes) goûteux; mais liquide; suivi de l'assiette du débutant; constituée de patates; de choucroute; de patates; de saucisse; de patates; le tout accompagné de patates. Ah j'oubliais : il avait aussi des patates. Son assiette n'était pas froide; mais pas chaude non plus; probablement à cause de la lenteur du service. Déjà que des pierogis ce n'est pas excellent; imaginez s'ils sont à peine tiède! Son dessert lui; était identique au mien; mais farci de pommes; ce qui le rendait un peu plus agréable; malgré la trop forte dose de canelle...Voilà ma critique du Stash Café. Mon verdict? C'était intéressant de découvrir cette cuisine pratiquement inconnue; surtout au Québec; mais je n'y retournerai probablement pas. Par contre; si jamais j'y vais encore; je m'assurerai que ce sera à une heure de plus grand achalandage. Le service sera sûrement plus rapide et les plats encore chauds.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,F6MPrQ5oxQL2Wq1v5ENDzA,WfOsRoD7JDci97B2jO41Lw,4,Walking around Old Montreal; we got hungry.   We saw this cute corner cafe with lots of people inside; so we decided to check it out...The staff seems very unorganized.   We waited a long time to have someone greet us or take our name.    Finally my BF approached someone and things got a bit more organized.   We got seated about 10-15 min after our arrival. ..We decided to get some small plates:  Krokiet; Kielbasa; Pierogies and Placki.    All of them were very good.   The Kielbasa was a bit salty; but not bad.   The Placki were crispy; crunchy; excellent...Advise to make reservations if you can; that will help with the wait.     They have a full bar and take credit cards.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,laaC_7aQ5mWm6BNSfHJ8fA,37IGYqte9l8icllJr3JnCQ,4,Located on Rue Saint Paul; Stash Cafe claims to be a family owned Polish restaurant. The place looks cozy with vintage wooden furniture and red lamps. There's a Piano at the entrance.  There will be someone playin the piano everyday after  6 pm. Don't forget to tip em. The owner of the place is really cool. I was sitting at the bar and chatting with her. I told her I'm new in Montreal & she was suggesting me good local restaurants. Also visit their washroom if you get a chance. Worth the trip O_O.                Food is fresh. Portions are generous. It seems to be a bit pricey; but Its a fancy place in Old Montreal so I saw this coming. All in all a good place to visit if you crave for polish food..Food -  Good.Service - friendly.Ambiance - Cosy.Worth the money - Um.... Uh.... Yes     o_O
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,h5SdcG89oimSDaBbERg3MQ,3J2OHs_Gc9f1AytGB72KCA,5,Being a Polish girl from Pittsburgh...I know a thing or two about pierogies. What a fun surprise to go to Montréal and find a Polish restaurant!  Our horse & buggy driver gave us the recommendation and I wish I could have found him to give him a big thank you!  Stash Cafe is so cozy with its stone walls and wood beamed ceiling...felt just like we were in Europe.  My husband and I ordered the kielbasa dish & the pierogies and split our meals so we could try a bit of each. SO so good!!!!!  Get there before 6; after that there was a wait...on a Sunday!  This should tell you how great this place is. We will be back.....
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,LQG9wFTmscbAATp8QWj1hg,27CW0M3qImOnWICX4XUBuQ,5,Ahhh so delicious!!!! My Polish teacher took me out for a beautiful lunch here at Stash Cafe. In the past they are not opened on Mondays; but we were both surprised they were open November 30!!! A Monday and Andrzejki (St. Andrew's Day)! ..The lovely lunch at 12:30 was peaceful; 3-4 tables of customers. Very quiet. The interior is absolutely gorgeous. You can impress anyone here!..Stash makes good traditional Polish dishes such as .- pierogi $13 we asked them for a mix. So we had some with meat stuffing; some with cheese and potato (l love this one); and the rest with mushrooms and cabbage; topped with caramelized sweet onions.- krokiet $4.50 one crispy roll (like a fried dumpling) with mushrooms or meat. I had the mushrooms and it was great; I gobbled it up fast..- barszcz soup; which is beets soup; deep wine red in colour and supposedly spicy. Stash's is not spicy at all; but still flavourful and quite nice. It's best when hot so don't let it sit!..The best Polish dishes are perhaps at your Polish friend's home; but Stash Cafe fills the void and with wonderful service. They have Polish beer and wine; as well as the incredibly delicious crepes with cheese; topped with sugar; sweet strawberries and fruits. You do in fact eat this as dinner in Poland; but here in Montreal this is a dessert. And it was sooooooo delicious. This is officially my favourite crepe of all time.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,1u6zz0xpKrIyjL0hljR2_g,ehCtgphdeS99wJpvzc-osw,4,Finally; Good food in Montreal. I was looking for good polish food and decided to try Stash Cafe. Very nice restaurant. There is a piano player and the ambiance is very relaxing. We ordered cabbage rolls; pork chop and pirogi. All we super good. Being from California; we never eat sauerkraut because it tastes terrible.  Many of the dishes came with sauerkraut and it was FANTASTIC. They make their own and it was the perfect compliment to the meal. Make sure to get dessert also. :-)
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,pZDmoYqX5AY8D_zAJ9Zheg,keXn-A58p5YnOMU1VUG8Fw,5,The food is Great. Everything was fresh and good service. As good as any place in Poland.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,RAzwrPeV5CPVdsLZn14gKg,AzV9uBeYf7DxeeKeT6RTVg,5,Great experience. With social media usually highlighting the worst of restaurants I had my doubts about trying this place. What a pleasant surprise.  The place is rustic and beautiful. The staff is very friendly.  The food left me in awe. One of my best dining experiences. The pierogi; polish sausage; the cabbage rolls; the crepes; etc... were absolutely delicious. Highly recommended
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,661MFQ0yitb6K6j-ur7Nlg,jlU5fVfsRRllnXI1s66pGA,5,We walked in; without a reservation; for an early Saturday dinner; and were fortunate enough to get a table. Our meal was fabulous. I had the pork and rice stuffed cabbage rolls with salad of the day; which ironically was pickled red cabbage. It was really  wonderful and filling; and reminded me of meals with my Russian grandparents. Hubs had the veal schnitzel with egg which was an enormous portion and delicious. We skipped dessert as we had a performance to attend. I would imagine a reservation would helpful if eating at normal dinner hour.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,ICGQ28nuTouYK3gkY9x0NA,aVwsLgvLR5csbunuGFE6ug,5,Enjoy Polska cuisine in a rustic environment in downtown Montreal..Don't miss the borsht; pirogies and specially the Snitzel with egg..simply delicious..All with a glass of Wiborowa vodka and a Zwieck beer...Enjoy
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,a1EB8JCP7V1UcjlkNg7HWg,NaqlFGymG7XGcrfWXjyycw,5,This place is amazing. The space is charming inside; service is helpful and efficient; and the food is outstanding. The Bloody Polak is the best bloody Mary I've ever had by far -- pickle; horseradish and tons of black pepper. To. Die. For. We started with potato pancakes which were just how my dad makes them. Comforting and delicious. We then had kielbasa with sauerkraut & potato salad; perogies; and crepes. All of which were simply perfect. Whether you've had Polish food before or not; definitely check it out for something different and memorable.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,gfQqQYI5_hCAGEHlHXIz2Q,2-d_MbYYnqQvR_m5j8Ay1Q,4,Mmm...Polish food.  Stash is a great place to try Polish food.  The cuisine has both simple dishes (prepared to taste anything but simple or boring) for the timid eater like pierogi or pork chops as well as dishes that pack a wallop of flavor like zurek (sour soup) or bigos (stew with meat and sour cabbage)...Friendly service and tasty food.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,wOFHqwk508Oxn3Aug53pBg,HxS-6ruhQU1djXf2IzcZwA,4,I loved it here! The ambience was dimly lit yet warm and cozy. The food was very authentic; and delicious. The service was great; and all of the wait staff speak Polish (and english) . They can explain the dishes if you don't really know what you're getting into.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,4zwopb7ofCqnqZE5WAG_CA,58VFzieKB-RWO41Z8Hwg-w,5,I came with my family last night; the staffs are very nice; and the foods were delicious. It was my first time to try Polish cuisine; the potato pancake was surprisingly good. Very impressed restaurant.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,1r4dMBX9nJJ0PTi2RcIZVQ,k-qppoV_ZkYVFvfe2P1f9w,3,We're from the U. S. and we don't speak French; beyond a few common phrases. We were seated quickly and treated like we were an imposition; even though we go to great lengths to avoid the ugly (often well-founded) stereotypes of our fellow citizens. Our server was stoic to the point of surly with us; while chatting and laughing with nearby customers; who were also clearly tourists. We kept wondering what we had done. But; whatever; we don't need to be loved; just seemed like poor form. For what it's worth; the pieriogis; kraut; and kielbasa were adequate; but nothing special. We tipped 20%...we're not assholes.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,X45i6LSzlWL9cqNRRqKHhg,Tbq_ZbwXihgFRFu5qN-i9g,5,Excellent food. Good drinks. Highly recommend. Tasted more authentic than chicago. Great atmosphere.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,T-ci3jRz09lTOtO13qCBuQ,efbHkQVJ0AHwq04E_E6t2A,4,Great food and wonderful atmosphere. Had the Debutant and split an order of cabbage rolls with my dining companion. Everything was delicious. The cabbage rolls were served with a nice; slightly spicy tomato sauce.  The filling was very tender and flavorful. Pirogies were also very good. The Debutant gives you a nice selection; so if you are not familiar with Polish food; it is a great place to start. .If I was spending a long weekend in Montreal and could only choose two or three restaurants for dinner; this would definitely be on the list.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,IxUo_G36GuYOMNzCOWrhsg,NPFcyFOUN_r5TDsMY7PXag,4,Eight of us strolled in on a Tuesday for lunch.  We ordered multiple things including different varieties of perogie as well as a mushroom crepe; stuffed cabbage borsch; and pork cutlet.  The cutlet was crispy and tasty; truly the star of the meals.  The Perogi we well prepared (boiled) and quite tasty with the mushroom as well as the potato varieties being sampled.  The mushroom crepe was truly outstanding; full of mushrooms and was cooked to crispy perfection.  The borsch was decent and served hot. The stuffed cabbage was the minus one star from perfection.  It had a spice that didn't belong like rosemary or thyme.  Prepared well... but didn't go along with the amazing flavors of everything else.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,_7fXfeHDzp3EOW8-kzUL6g,ni_NxsPartOlyuxmARUtMg,4,Really enjoyed this place. Service was fantastic and the live piano that started at 6pm cinched it. I had the platter; which came with a starter soup; main plate with pirogies; a meat filled croquette; potato pancake and pork & cabbage stew. The whole thing was followed by a peach crumble with a generous serving of cream and green tea (you could choose from other teas and coffee). If I had to criticize anything; the platter was very heavy; all one colour and salty. I couldn't finish the croquette which felt dry. The pirogies were the best part: covered in caramelized onions and half filled with meat and the other half were filled with potato and cheese. The potato pancake balanced the salty stew. I would come back for the pirogies; live music; great service and cozy ambiance.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,9KZpsJnp7kp7QesinQrUjA,groiijB9o3tliEMa5qR4MQ,4,Yes; the Polish restaurants you'll find in NYC are better; hands down. But Stash Cafe did not disappoint at all. They have a new drink menu and the Bloody Polak was so good; we ordered it twice!  We had golobki (stuffed cabbage); flaczki (tripe soup); & barsz (beet soup). The beet soup was tasty but just a tad salty.  The other two items seemed like they had an ingredient or two missing. However; overall the taste was pretty good. Granted we came here in the middle of the afternoon when it was virtually empty; but service was excellent. Our waiter even helkpled us with directions to Olympic Stadium; which was our next stop.  Everyone who works there is Polish & seems to speak Polish as well; which is a nice touch to the authenticity of the restaurant.  The ambiance is also great; with wooden tables and chairs. If I'm ever in Montreal again; I'll definitely stop by this place again!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,Tb-JkeFvX9krPI3kCYtCnQ,tS5_YQ8KQOswhKVhrGRyZQ,4,We wanted a small bite before a dinner reservation later that night. Service was really good. Vodka was good. I loved the pierogies. My favorite was the cabbage and mushroom. We also shared the kielbasa which was good too. All around a good stop!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,wKVYRn7sHtQYbk3_S2-kRg,4yt9ZtMREcUOPPrw0D3cVw,5,What a gem in Montreal. The menu is authentic; service is great and food is delicious. I've offered my recommendation to several colleagues and will gladly return next time Polish food is the preference in Montreal.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,CcxFuBuqO6qAgqHAmcW4_g,QQ1vFgPu2BzW6sBCJrM6TQ,5,Yummyyyy..... never had Polish food before... my husband has and I loved it ...specially the beet soup.... a must have !! and great value for money
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,eqbcTJOhH0G13by8wG-YXg,aBxKRstxYRkXiSdvwOO_-w,5,Great polish food experience! Very good from the soup to the black sausage! I could eat here weekly
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,C0bn6f7mqw_JZuHQ0Y3-_Q,sSetOVd3yx5MLn3drwXV0w,4,Wow! We weren't expecting to have old-world Polish food on a warm June evening; but man; was it good!! We enjoyed the perogies; potato pancakes and duck; among others. The Borsch was a consume and a little too salty for my taste; so that would be the only thing I would avoid. The service was friendly...Oh yes; the piano player was a nice touch too. Varied and fun song selection...Try it; you'll love it! I will be back!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,kztt8HlhfZVhhbgbLsNRTw,3T4F7mfdUcelW2Wl10Nayw,5,Super happy with our meal. We enjoy Polish food when we can find it and this little restaurant is a gem. we started with the Borscht; a beet broth soup that was served hot with a dollop of sour cream. Then some fresh Rye bread with butter. For the main course we all ended up getting the mixed plate. It had Perogies; a Potato Pancake; a meat croquet; and the most delicious sauerkraut! It was rich and filling. The sauerkraut was cooked with beef and sausage providing a flavor that was out of this world!!! The meal ended with coffee and a fruit cobbler of choice. I had the peach with creme-fresh on top! The ambiance was comfortable and the service was wonderful. We felt welcome as guests of the restaurant and our server made sure that all of our needs were met. If I lived closer; I would become a regular.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,lOj4aC_jOZUy50OxqVPwFw,G1q2dPzuqbqtLIww2OWVSQ,4,Cozy; friendly Polish restaurant in beautiful Old Montreal area.  Took a walk from our hotel to get here and turning onto Rue Saint Paul was simply magical.  Modern buildings give way to cobblestone streets; historic 18th century (?) facades; and horse-drawn carriages.  Yeah; it's hokey and touristy; but I'm a sucker for that kind of thing...But definitely nothing gimmicky about the food here at Stash.  The ambience is unpretentious and friendly; darkly lit with a heavy emphasis on wood and old-world charm.  A piano player slightly separated from the main dining area played through the entire time we were there; providing a lovely unobtrusive musical accompaniment to supper...We shared the beet consommé; a salad; then a sausage appetizer; a mixed plate with pierogi; potato pancake; stewed cabbage; and a breaded beef crepe; and a meat-stuffed cabbage plate.  Finally; for dessert; we enjoyed a sweet cheese crepe.  So nothing too exotic; but all well-prepared and tasty.  These were recommended by our excellent waiter; who pretty much picked out our entire supper for us; checked in just a couple of times; and otherwise let us enjoy our evening...Delicious; homey; and reasonably-priced fare; we definitely enjoyed dining here and would love to come back next time we're in town.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,p6ahyv6b6cuEPApyYpXtlA,QJ97o5P7K6En5r0LfJyBQg,5,Hands down; best meal we had while in Montreal. Better than smoked meat and poutine together. Food and service were both  amazing. Perogies; stuffed cabbage and kielbasa - soooooooo good. Whenever back; this will be the one place we are sure to come back to. ..Also; everybody there was so awesome with little kids. They made it an extremely pleasant experience!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,rCuJ08CSv-J4_-3yiQCy-Q,_w3cZ9k_iK0fgVU7B_X0NA,5,Excellent Polish schnitzel; was very pleased. In a long street of many adorable and hopping places; this is one with the talented piano player & old world vibe  pulled me in. Highly recommend!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,a4gjUC7Haow0pf7dbakvGw,RwuU6v8xYiqGUa62DsGHcw,5,Quality authentic polish food in Montreal!! Super friendly and welcoming staff. We ordered the borscht; veal schnitzel; all 3 kinda of pierogi; the beef stroganoff; and the pickled herring and everything was incredible!! Great prices and would recommend making reservations
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,fW6r7n27FBPHCyJBmMcA1g,tuDu5EA6sL4Wn_NTogn_Dg,4,While on Montreal for business for a few days and staying in the old town; I have bumped into this traditional polish restaurant for a casual dinner...This is an old school classic eastern european restaurant that has lots of tradition and less novelty. ..The food now; what can I say? good borsh (sour beet soup); really good pierogi (which is the polish equivalent for ravioli); an excellent polish sausage and some mighty fine polish and Lithuanian beer were sampled...bottom line: everything was good and service was great!..The atmosphere is very warm; the owners and the people who work there all speak polish; French and English. the place is very warm and features live piano on evenings.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,OsWoY-IajEhD2mUKgG8fwA,dF_Qy9PPOkbxZjHFCEtMYA,5,The food and atmosphere here is UNBELIEVEABLE!!!..I must have come here at least 30 times the past 3 years. You will not be disappointed!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,xe97D4an3F0KYjdf0QI0Dw,NV_wcGW55W9lrDzglWx-GQ,4,A nice cozy place for Polish comfort food in Old Montreal. The old-world atmosphere is nice and very consistent with the food. The menu includes many of the Eastern European standards - potato pancakes; perogi; kielbasa and combinations thereof..Service was very attentive. .This place would be a great option on a cold winter day.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,HF8k3B7g7xk3wJZj3wK1Vg,YluJHHNDjdHrk4_wEqrW6A,5,This place was amazing.  Their potato pancakes were delicious (Would have never thought to put so much garlic and sour cream and applesauce on it). Their dumplings were also very yummy and I had the tripe soup which was; once again; very yummy. Their dessert was also wonderful-- I had the hazelnut cake and it was the perfect; decadent end to a perfect meal. The service was also very professional. I would love to go here with my significant other.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,PvqKnq76j44ZSGzOc-I9UA,Mx52Uo-bAB3sKRNCZV1-eA,5,This was some of the best food I have ever had...It is a simple place.  Casual; with a piano player going at it on a Thursday night.  Two local beers were on tap and we had both; but there was a full bar and a variety of bottled beer as well...We had a Prix-Fixe meal for $30.  Choice of 5 appetizers.  The soups sounded good; but on a warm day we had the excellent pickled herring.  Certainly seemed to be homemade.  Next we had a sampler plate with 4 phenomenal pierogies; a meat roll; a cabbage and sausage stew; and potato pancakes.  Everything was great; although I found the cabbage to be a little sweet.  Fruit crumbles for desert.  ..Friendly quick service and great food.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,L2lSnnyht3fB-ONcU2NaFw,ogE34DrPk6Rw16K6XkymaQ,4,Great place.  The food is delicious and considering its Old Montreal not terribly pricey.  The atmosphere/decor feels authentic without being kitschy.  The food is very good and decent sized portions.  My salad was fresh and green.  I wish there was a 4 1/2 stars.  This place deserves it.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,Wm3KWBXmG6BQqMd_aCIoVg,AX9Kb68MhaBgc5vDuvIw-w,1,Hello everyone !.Were  at this place about month ago . For dinner . Came especially because of live piano music. Came around 8.30 pm for dinner and live music was already finished . What sense to lie people that you have dinner with live music ? Do both understand ..I definitely know what means polish food same as all European food as we are from eastern part of Europe . PEOPLE ATTENTION: this place is extremely overpriced and they have no any idea what is Eastern Europe food ! This is probably interesting for tourists who never tried European food and not aware how it should look like . Prices are overpriced but if it was good real authentic polish food I would never write this kind of review ! .!!!!!Polish borsch !!!!: it was just water of beet color without nothing inside . Just water !!!!! Looked like liquid from CANNED BEETS ROOTS from grocery store for 2  dollars a can  .OMG it was disaster ; not borsch ! Just go google and check real photos of polish borsch and thin ten times before ordering borsch at this place !!! .We ordered two glasses  of wine and never even see our waitress again to propose us any other wine or water or whatever ...... BECAUSE SHE WAS BUSY !!! She was having her dinner just in from of us at bar counter . She was eating so rushly and greedy ; tasting all her fingers all the time !!! After 20 min we ask another girl what problem with our waiter and she just answered - she is busy she is eating habits !!!! SERIOUSLY !!!!!! You have customers oh my god and you are in Canada ; what kind of service you provide to your customers for prices you take from them??!?!?!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,9VwP2u3EjRMwKnibLJ4GlQ,b_c9dmFFf6CXW-sxOym-Qw,5,Love! The potato pancake appetizers were fantastic. The atmosphere is cozy with live piano playing but quiet enough for good conversation. Had the kielbasa dinner one night and cabbage rolls on another night - went twice in one week. Will come back the next time I'm in town for sure!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,03bowRxuOy6g8KdNx3ogHA,ZNnxXKrzif8FjZCs0kqQGA,4,Decided to go to this place after I read online it was one of the best places to eat for under $20. It succeeded.  Cozy atmosphere in a historic building. We went on a Saturday for brunch. The eggs were cooked perfect ; crepes with the raspberry and cheese inside were good not overly sweet; and perrogi mixed selection were excellent. This was one of the best places I've been to in Montreal.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,j6Obpkoz_4oWyxAuUsM8vA,IXcrAVL1yKMICHyvjk3gMQ,5,Fantastic experience. Nice use of some old church pews for seating; great food- Perogis were exceptional. Live pianist playing Chopin. Normally I don't drink vodka but tried my husband's Zubrowka and ordered my own.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,z7vFhuTstnUBpn1GGThJqQ,xfDVD_siU7QDSIpk5bi2qw,3,Good service! Cool vibe & decent polish food.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,RrHpMoZHv6xb4RyR5T35dA,yjC79PCc673w1ZaHIMb9dg,4,Delicious! I had the pierogi and my husband had the hunters stew. Great service and food.... Just a bit pricey; but on par with the neighborhood.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,AXTnFadSG9KQeuFExrNTUw,Sgf-oWba9TJw30I9DvEmmw,4,Awesome atmosphere!! Food above decent but not the best polish food I've had. Server was borderline rude; but it didn't ruin my dinner. She made up for it by giving my kids something to color. Good food for the price.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,IrCmkFm_00BRBHj2zE_Xhg,W9WYXS79_pLCVqhSX5PDOg,4,lunch recently; drinks were ok and small; food was great; had the veal schnitzel and wife had the nalesniki; service was pleasant; good food!!!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,ZXadVo4RajtjTkorwGC42A,iAcLfSNa-wHnJhBTGE04Mw,5,Stash cafe was delicious! Based on other reviewers; we ordered the potato pancakes; which were delicious. For my main; I ordered the pierogies; my personal favorite was the potato and cheese filling but the beef and mushroom/cabbage fillings were also delicious. My mom raved about her kielbasa; and the rest of my table were satisfied with their dishes too...Overall; Stash Cafe's food is wholesome and hearty; perfect for a cold day. It's hard to believe how they can make meat and potatoes so flavorful and sophisticated!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,GXYs7BReFbnirPttsTBxpA,3t7d35yX4u7eYECxvJRL8A,1,I would love to give this place 4 stars as the food is good; but based on the three visits I have to go with one star. ..The first time at the Stash we ordered Pirogi and another dish. Then the Pirogi arrived it had a wrong filling and instead of the 8 pieces as started on the menu there was only 7 pieces on the plate. The mistake was corrected with a new plate from the kitchen. ..Second time at the Stash ordered Pirogi and another dish. Again received Pirogi with wrong filling. Had to wait for correct order to arrive from the kitchen. ..The third time ordered Duck and another dish. After 1 hour and 20 minutes nothing arrived. Inquired with the waiter three times about the food and each time were told that it is almost ready. Customers at three tables around all arrived after we were seated and all had their appetizers and main dishes served and finished while we were still waiting for our food. Our waiter was unpleasant and unfriendly. After 1 hour and 20 minutes we got up and left hungry and angry. Extremely disappointing! I don't know if they forgot to put the order in or did not have a duck to serve; but there should of been a way to avoid this. Give a customer an appetizer or something... Be honest... Be friendly... You can't make people wait for food for an hour and 20 minutes... If the duck is not ready to be served serve the other items that were ordered. Offer something on the house... Do something!..I am greatly disappointed in Stash. The food that we tried was good; but overall I can't recommend it. There are gazillion great food places in Montreal and Stash simply does not cut it.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,JMAktCIiGtvhwmUDvZstEw,I_ZWXb6hsuNS3o-kGvIXUg,5,One reviewer below went on & on about how she knows Eastern European food & how Stash is probably good for tourists who basically don't know better. I must strongly disagree with everything that person wrote. We have had a lot of Eastern European food; both in Europe; San Francisco and New York & Brooklyn. Good friends of our are Polish & have cooked for us as well. Additionally; we've made at least 18 long trips to Hungary where they serve food similar to Polish cuisine so we've had our share of sausages; borscht; etc...We ate at Stash Cafe twice during a visit to Montreal in August this year. On our second visit we also took a German friend. Quite frankly; we all loved this place and the food. Two other of our friends dined at Stash Cafe in the last month & also loved the food. The interior is cozy & has some nice Polish artworks on display. On both our visits were walk-ins; but it does tend to get busy; so perhaps reservations are a good idea. ..We had numerous dishes between us: bigos; pierogi; kielbasa; golabki (stuffed cabbage); & a wonderful charcuterie plate & even the smalec (a spread of bacon fat). Everything we had was delicious! Service was friendly & helpful. On our second visit the place was mobbed so the orders took a bit longer but; heck; we were on vacation so we just enjoyed our beer & conversation & the very nice; live; piano music.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,JvJ-JPGvr41z4Plq-bPI6g,5,Cute; quiet cosy resto. Service is pleasant and prompt.  The lunch special is only $14 and includes a soup and main dish. The perogi plate is only $14 and covered with caramelized onions; sauteed shredded cabbage and sour cream. ..I asked for a mixed plate of perogies: meat; cheese & potato; mushroom and cabbage. But the meat one was the best tasting of them all.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,KPGAea3ge5EGZGGkiovgeQ,u6Kdx6QAWizm8BM6bjEMMw,5,Had one of the best meals in Montreal here. Definitely planning on going back if I find myself in Canada again.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,ZozeRlq1OuAl5uDg1cYIcA,kHE0MVfxvX0QHoTD7XZ-aw,4,It was quite by accident that we found ourselves at a second Polish restaurant in as many days during our recent visit to Montreal. We had made hasty reservations elsewhere but upon discovering that it had an ambience somewhere between a punk rock club and a frat party a quick change of plans was needed. It was Saturday night and Vieux Montreal was hopping; would we be stuck eating Poutine again? We spotted this place and it looked busy but it never hurts to try. Surprisingly and to our relief; she looked around and said just a few minutes and I can fit you in. Great!..So we sat on a bench inside while we waited and took in the ambience. It was completely full; with tables of all sizes densely packed. But not in a claustrophobic way. The effect was almost like a jigsaw puzzle: the tables as interlocking pieces filling the cozy historic stone-walled dining room. Soon our table was ready and we were escorted; right into the heart of the animated scene...We looked at the menu and everything looked good; with all the standard Polish fare one would expect. But for some reason we were both attracted to the appetizers. There were six and we wanted them all. So we pointed to the appetizer page page and asked for one of everything. Plus a salad...Now probably appetizers are not the best way to judge a restaurant; as they can sometimes be rather simple and not where the chef shows off his talents. But no matter. They were all very good and exactly what we hoped for. We had: Krokiet (breaded crepe roll stuffed with meat and mushrooms); Placki (potato pancakes); Pierogies (pastries stuffed with various savory fillings); Kielbasa sauteed with onions; Sledz (picked herring); and something else which escapes me. All simple plain food; just what we expected and hoped for. The only surprise to me was the sauerkraut: much milder than I am used to; with less salt and vinegary tang. I liked it though...I'd love to go back someday and try some of the entrees. Maybe next visit?..For dessert we got a slice of hazelnut cake. Plenty big enough to share. Good enough though not memorable...Some Yelpers have mentioned problems with the service. I couldn't disagree more. Our server was efficient; friendly; and made us feel right at home from the moment we came inside...I almost forgot to mention the piano player. He sat at an ancient upright piano and played throughout the evening. Mostly old jazz and jazzy renditions of old pop tunes. I only wish we would have played some Chopin (who was Polish). Be sure to tip him; he helped to make the place feel special.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,F4xjKVePMIzRlfeImBQHsg,H68zwvqvbyCTo7N28fYHdA,5,We always go there when we are in Montreal. The ambiance is great and service is always nice and efficient. It is a place to relax; talk and enjoy the atmosphere. ..The food is great. Authentic Polish dishes like the pierogi are the highlight of the menu. I always order the dish that had four different samples of Polish staples. We had dessert the last time we were there and it was delicious. For me; the best option in Vieux Montréal.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,BKQs6LMHlygTyl7t7bMuKA,7SYHAL8M-Eze86xiJH24lQ,4,Came here for lunch with the fam on vacation.  Delicious food; nice service.  Everything tasted good from the pierogis; cabbage rolls; crepes and schnitzel.  Would definitely recommend.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,fvGzY3GapUa3do3fefbVMg,jVjJYR_9YF4StAmyegKWtg,5,I LOVE this place. I'm a huge fan of polish food and they have tons of dishes that are made out of cabbage and potatoes! mmmmm.. super good  pierogi. Located in a good part of montreal nice to walk around after dinner. .Cant wait to go back to eat here again!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,_qq9CYQRYYitbXAOl9B2Eg,GdDLKmw8ZwX9R6_QL2v5jA,4,Stopped here for lunch while walking through the old city on an unexpectedly crisp fall day.  The warm atmosphere and hearty food was just what we needed.  Husband had the cabbage stew and loved it.  I had the pierogi.  Good pierogi (and side of 'kraut); but in a little too much oil/butter for my taste.  Fast; friendly service.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,MUO2meJxp6AlIQgsIQ4B6w,BBot3G-Xs_n8JwhUgtJeyg,5,Loved the food so much we went back the next day for drinks and appetizers; before we went over to Garde Manger. Really impressed with the selection and quality of the food; and highly recommend getting a number of appetizers to share. Once you decide on the appetizer you like the most; order it as a meal if you're staying for dinner. ..My favourite are the potato pancakes and make sure to ask for both the sour cream and the Apple sauce. Apple crumble for dessert if you have room.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,06Gguh_3JC7q-ZOhe92ROg,EqLYZXNedv7FK7-2mecQtQ,4,We ate an early dinner as we had spent the day walking. We decided on Stash for a nice change. I had the sausage & kraut. The sausage was So Good & flavorful. DH had a prefix meal that included a little of everything. It had what they call a stew; beef & kraut; It was Yum!  Stash is a nice quiet place for a good change of pace meal. I had a club soda & vodka with a twist; So perfect on a hot day in September!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,N9tgUEYnMvdZSDDAZ46sJg,PfmlcGxIg8LWlKLVCGghvQ,4,This was an accidental wander up to menu and decide on whim to go in; good decision! Cloud like Peroigi; a perfect beet borscht; eggs w sautéed spinach and potato cakes.  Nice nice service too.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,hywboQIFn4kmaAEXvUTBJA,d6SBzcdVvse4p0Aaqm0T4w,5,I've had several meals in Poland; and the food served at the Stash Cafe is very authentic. My wife & I shared a kielbasa appetizer. The sausage was served with sautéed onions and brown mustard - delicious! We both had pierogi for a main course. The plate generously came with eight pierogi and a side of sauerkraut. Our favorite of the group was potato and cheese. Service was appropriately attentive. Overall; we had an excellent experience!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,wM8ZY7-W0uBXk60AXJucuQ,PTn6Eb8Ik5ki22NIe4drAw,4,I was in Krackow and Warsaw last summer and really enjoyed Polish food; it was on point. We passed this restaurant as were searching for our meal and on a Saturday in old Montreal; good luck trying to get a table. We waited 20 minutes and it was well worth it. The schnitzel was not greasy and light. The potato pancakes are to die for..ligt and crispy. The goulash flank steak with mushroom sauce was delicious with the best red beet salad!   .The atmosphere was great; decent prices and the service was excellent. Must try that is diffrent from the rest of the tourist trap.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,Wb5nSzyTaoS6OCEfOGVBvA,ZfJ-A8YGY1D1efKUom69Sw,5,Excellent. Had white sausage soup followed by the wild boar. Boar was very tender and delicious. (Polish)Friends had the hunter stew and the duck. All just delicious and tasted very authentic. Sorry I don't know the polish names but you cannot go wrong here for a great meal. Good beer list also.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,UgXrMmqCRiRu1MVBMFlYSw,0UNSCV5L4p2pVp-RGZW48w,5,We were staying in Old Montreal during a conference my husband attended in late October. We were looking for a family friendly restaurant near out hotel with decent food and this fit the bill and the food was excellent; I'm half Polish and know good Polish food. ..We had pierogi; potato pancakes and cabbage rolls and all tasted like my grandma's homemade dishes; only better (sorry grandma).  The waiter was pleasant and social and when we forgot our bib after our meal; he called our hotel and let us know!..Great food; great atmosphere; live piano during dinner--all around great experience!  Will visit again when we return to Montreal.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,_zNNZnzAZYx2u1xZLxWnjA,ZU7ZO5CsRJdPQwYhnupsLg,5,Wow...My husband and I went to Old Towne yesterday and saw this little gem; but I had already agreed we'd pay homage to HIS heredity and have Phó (that review is also included!).  But; we tucked this in the back of our minds and I'm glad we did!..The staff was an extremely pleasant woman who was fluent in English; Polish; and French.  She was sweet; attentive; and knew the city like the back of her hand.  She recommended our vodka and suggested to accompany it with apple juice; a chaser if you will.  She said it was how the Polish do it; so why not?  When in Rome.....It was smooth; strong; and I felt content immediately.  The turpentine aftertaste (all vodka does to me; regardless of brand; but some better than others!) was immediately quashed by the sweetness of the juice.  I will never drink vodka any other way hereafter!..I am an embarrassment to my Polish and Irish heritage - I hate cabbage (!) - so I went with the pierogies.  Cheese.  My husband was easily swayed into the  gobki...My dish came artfully arranged with a sprinkle of dill; a heaping side of sauerkraut and carrot shaped into a rosette.  My husband's order was accompanied by a cucumber/dill sauce mix and sliced boiled potatoes...The pierogies tasted like my Babçi came back to life and got work in their kitchen.  Very authentic.  Dipped in the side bowl of sour cream; it was delicious!..My husband inhaled his dish (and half of mine) within seconds; which usually is a sign he likes it.  The gobki appeared to have an abundance of ground meat; which is a nice change from the rice-laden  cabbage rolls I usually see.  He stated the tomatoes were an excellent topping; as it was a bit dry inside of the roll.  He found the cucumber/dill muxture to be divine.  Not his words; but wicked good isn't exactly poetry; but a good description nonetheless!..The ambience is divine and the bar nicely stocked.  (side note: the building's side door also gives access to bathrooms without going through the restaurant). Our waitress informed us live music is usually at the restaurant nightly of we wanted to cone back for dessert and Polish coffee (coffee with vodka....of course!)..The menu may have been simple and don't offer a huge array of options; but sometimes that can be overwhelming.  So points today for simplicity...If you are a fan of Polish food - this is authentic as it gets.  A MUST when in Montreal and desire something different than American and after a few days in Quebec; something different than French!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,alo15oiFG4E1bEFTrb6G4A,aWHrhau0S98omp_uypl8UQ,5,Great polish cuisine! Perfect service. .Tastes like good old polish home cooking..I'll definitely come back when in Montreal
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,kbyxFChwMzukTasy9lRHTA,j1ilXj9gyzAN2LCWRaDLDA,4,Perhaps a Polish restaurant seems out of place in Vieux-Montréal? Well worry not; since this one's definitely worth a visit...I; too; was planning to go somewhere more French; but I ended up here for dinner and definitely don't regret it. The ambiance inside is classy and comfortable: prints hanging on the walls; a pianist playing in the corner; and red lighting giving the whole restaurant an eerie glow. It feels like stepping out of Montréal and into a different country...For food; I got the Menu du Débutant Table d'Hôte. The starter was a piping hot borscht. The main course was a hearty collection of different appetizers (pierogi; a potato pancake; a croquette; and bigots). And for dessert; I got an apple cobbler with cream (good but unremarkable)...Overall it was a tasty meal and a fun experience. Pay Stash a visit if you want something unique and different for your next meal.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,2-5Ty9-lUW7IQyyEnp0Hcw,7vS_8bRkojtPG0VvF91XgA,3,I came to Stash on a friend's recommendation; and left pleasantly surprised. The pork rolled in cabbage and mixed pierogis were both delicious. Both tasted homemade; in a good way. ..I had to knock off one star because they appeared to be understaffed. A couple diners near us decided to leave due to inattentive service (i.e. not getting water or menus) while we were there. Even though the restaurant was half empty at the time; the one waiter who was working couldn't keep up.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,0Hh53SYAw7JYclTCShWLbg,w5OBgG3iyw4YbD0VxsF37g,4,This is my first experience with Polish food. The service was good and friendly. We order pierogi (dumplings) and bigos (cabbage stew). There are three flavored of dumplings; mushrooms; potato cheese; and beef. I like the mushroom one the most. The other two are just ok to me. The cabbage stew is well seasoned; but a bit too salty for me. The mushrooms in cabbage stew are good but only few pieces. There are many sausages and pork in the stew. The portion is pretty big. I only can finish half. .The pianist start to play around 6pm. It gives the restaurant even better feeling with live music. .I'm very happy with the experience.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,wz_Fqp4ilv3H-cFjGeY4ng,y4cUxHikEOzBsrHtcaByAg,5,Definitely worth it! My family of four came here for lunch... we didn't have reservations and had to wait but the food was worth the wait! We shared the peurogi's and I had the steak tips; and a bunch of other food... in addition to dessert! Everything was great!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,XYDyktd9zsqPvJxxSTDxNw,oBHdGXlsFca59tRJpdLcsw,5,this is an amazing polish restaurant that knows how to serve some seriously good comfort food...we got the last open table (without reservations) and we were so happy we did b/c dinner was awesome...pierogies - holy sh*t; so so so good.  you don't need the sour cream.  just absolutely delicious...house vegetable soup - sounded totally boring but i really wanted some veggies and it was possibly the BEST soup i have had in the last decade.  so much so that when i got home; i googled the recipe and tried to reproduce it at home.  that's how good it was.  ..we both got the combo platter: beef wrapped in crepe; more pierogies; cabbage and pork; and potato cakes.  and more sour cream.  ..fantastic and highly recommend..unbelievable (in a good way) service.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,stdqCbuhoJsUQKl44bxn2Q,R9ebdYLzyZx9SwPgfU3aBQ,5,Seriously shocked how good the food was. The service was great and the food...you leave here very happy. I honestly wished I would have tried it early cause I would have eaten here daily.  It's literally that good.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,qKpkRCPk4ycbllTfFcRbNw,H-xscxe9bRaeGSFP53VRWg,3,Brunch polonais les fds; relativement petite portion donc pensez à prendre une entrée; bon service; ambiance de cave ; joli.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,9HC8ZvFj5VFMuPlCCHNwow,h_d7qjP9Q_MuANZybM5VGg,5,We went at 4:30 and the place was almost empty; so the service was great. The pierogis were amazing; especially the potato and cheese. Kielbasa was delicious as well. The building is lovely; and it is definitely worth a trip to the bathroom just to see the beautiful stairs. May have to go back before we leave Montreal! Best meal we have had here all week.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,2C2wHU2z5hGavTTP6p6-pQ,xTVQYioqWhMsofRTNix-6g,5,Still one of the best places in Old Town. Service can be indifferent; but the food is great. Make a reservation if you can.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,uj8mjFaUQzmuVSDnaqff0w,B5fDQ6Q1VEHgP8-ULfJKtw,4,There was live music! The piano player was a talented gentleman who sat at the entrance! The music added to the yummy food eating experience. Went for dinner with a good friends of mine on 4/18/2015...For drinks we got a bloody caesar; vodka with tonic; and vodka with club soda. For dinner we ordered bigos (roasted meat; sausage; and lots of cabbage); krokiety (breaded meat and mushroom crepes with a side of salad and side of potato salad); and golabki (cabbage rolls stuffed with pork and rice with side of pickled red cabbage). Bigos was well made and tasty but did not look so appetizing. Krokiety had two separate crepes; one was meat and other was mushroom. The salad and potato salad were not so different from the American versions. Golabki was good as well and the pickled cabbage was a good compliment in regards to flavor but a lot of cabbage on the plate.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,dsvxYE__Mll9uiwBAUJSjw,W9LUq3s520o4MIK0AxC0Gg,5,My friend and I stumbled upon this place as we explored Old Montreal. As we walked by the storefront; someone opened the door and we heard the piano playing and we were just drawn inside. We didn't have a reservation so we were thankful they were able to seat us at the bar. ..The place has an incredible vibe; between the jazz music; the dim lighting; the old features. We ordered the entree of pierogies and the potato pancakes. And; to be really honest; I'm not sure I've eaten anything better in my life. The pierogies are topped with these perfect little onions that add the perfect flavor. The potato pancakes are crispy and flavorful. We both cried as we realized we had gone through the food so fast and ended up cutting our last pierogies into the tiniest bites in hopes to savor it for a little while longer. ..I'll be dreaming about this place until I make my way back to Montreal. In fact; I'll probably plan a trip just so that I can eat those pierogies again.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,w0eFvridg4LMKQXtO-t-Kg,IIcvP1z0WdK5gl3T0qvH0w,4,We discovered this place on a previous trip to Montreal; and it was on our list of places to eat when we returned to the city this past week. We got 3 big plates to share: potato pancakes with sour cream; a mixture of cabbage and cheese pierogies; and a pancake thing filled with mushrooms. It was all SO good. We had our 3 year old with us; so we couldn't linger and really enjoy the food like we wanted to. We had some potato pancakes left over; and we took them back to the hotel to maybe eat later on. They were ice cold when I finally got to them; but I didn't care. I still ate them.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,AN2pGjsPWE4pS3AdsyqFTw,4lQ_QNsrCfkdkE6iTXv9Xw,3,Food was good; but not excellent. I'm of eastern european descent; so many of these dishes are akin to what my family makes. Nothing special here. Service was just okay. Portions were small and prices were high. I would not come back - too much of a tourist trap.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,ZGmjA3NrrmcHVX3SoAWaZw,s6-GCtb1rLHah54O-l6obQ,4,Great casual Polish food.  We split the pancakes and the pierogis with a mix of meat; mushroom and potato/cheese for the latter.  All solid and tasty washed down with a beer.  Wish we had room for dessert.  I'd recommend going with the sour cream rather than the apple sauce but that's me.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,vhLEh3glqJ9-RRT9VR1Tmg,1z2xRRJ9MeiYVETZ21JMdA,5,What a nice place. We had friendly service; very good food and with the comfortable atmosphere all made for a wonderful dining experience.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,rS6v4WRa2gc36vVZN-BdCw,pn5RBecDIG10xGcjnXJUSQ,4,found this great little spot while wondering around old mtl... the piano player and friendly staff (and the fact that my gf is polish) sealed the deal for a dinner choice! had the mushroom filled crepes and potato pancakes to start followed by the cabbage rolls and pork schnitzel... it was all delicious!!! good portions and very reasonable priced for a great meal! if youre looking for some comfort food this is a spot for you!! will deff try to come back!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,LkQw66vxDazg7kMpsk1aIg,EByc7s4CjlxBsUXhqA-2dA,4,Enjoyed it a lot. Good crowd going on a Thursday night when I pulled in by chance - just walking by. Menu looked interesting. Casual but cozy atmosphere. Scored a decent table despite just walking in off the street with no reservation on a Thurs night and was seated quickly...Started with a chicken soup of the day and then the Sznycel Mielony - tasty ground meat with mushroom sauce served along with some fried potatoes and what I can only guess was some cabbage? should have asked; but it was good...Limited wine menu by the glass but I found a Canadian Mission Hill cab from the Okanagan Valley that went nicely.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,FcufsSaz59BJtNv3ibL10A,dXYd2FkCWVwblsgBlsM2Bw,4,Situated in the heart of Old Montreal; this place bustles with charm.  ..The ambiance is unique.  Some of the seats are church pews; and modern Eastern European art hangs from the ceilings.  A pianist's music echoes through the room as you dine under dim lights...On both visits to Stash Cafe; I had the Debutant; which gets you a delicious borscht; a yummy salad; a plate full of mixed pierogies; krokiety; bigos; and a potato pancake.  Dessert was a choice of homemade apple or plum crumble; served with a choice of tea or coffee (all for 29$!).  Everything was delicious; especially the borscht; pierogies and krokiety.  My partner tried the boar on his second run; but preferred the variety and flavors delivered by the Debutant...I can't wait for my next visit!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,UVs_7nPjqK_W_ap96IClpA,ruPBVQyIVET4GfI3wLma-g,5,What a great find for dinner!..This restaurant was super close to our hotel and it had some great reviews so I thought Why not?. I'm sure glad we came here because we were treated to a lovely polish meal; something you definitely won't find in Colorado. ..There were only a couple of groups seated when we arrived so we had no trouble getting a table. Our servers were kind and very attentive. We ordered the pierogis (cabbage and mushroom); two house salads; and the stroganoff. Everything was so delicious!! The salads came out first and they were lightly coated in a delectable dressing that reminded me of a Caesar but definitely had something else in it. I finished every leaf of lettuce! Next the pierogi which I ordered as a meal but there were only four small ones on the plate. However; they were tasty! Soft; juicy and flavorful I could have eaten a lot more. I even enjoyed the side of sauerkraut and usually I hate the stuff so that was pretty cool. I got to try a bit of the stroganoff which was excellent; meaty with a hearty amount of mushrooms. However; the star of the plate in my opinion was the potato pancakes because they were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. For some reason they also tasted like bacon?! I was definitely on board :)..In the end food is delicious; prices are fair and staff is friendly. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,VkECGYtW_5VAjIQFu5wx5w,nbeQC_qRH0SYD74-m0prEg,5,We saw polish food and wanted to try it out. The pierogi appetizer was a delicious start. We also hd the veal schnitzel and krokiety for entrees. Everything tasted fresh and homemade. Must try it out.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,rh58MAnrykqCw0cCmDoAMg,Ynfij7iDEk8TsSpzDF6MPA,5,Stumbled in on a rainy day. What a perfect treat to warm us up. Perogies were awesome!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,eZZ8rU6wq9IRIaQj_7Hr9Q,4ByBZJIvr62_vt6i8RugJw,5,Popped in for a bite on a whim. Yum!! Perfectly seasoned and well cooked. We got herring salad; pierogis; and some blinz thing filled with meat and potatoes; nothing was too greasy either. Even the side salad and side potato salad are worth mentioning: the salad was well dressed and the potato was seasoned with dill.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,gyDhEenNaue5yyiC0ppsqg,hW-3_sWt-DY22n0zjZarqg,5,I cannot recommend Stash Cafe enough to friends; family; strangers!  Just ignore the fact that Rachel Ray also loves it...Located in Old Montreal (Vieux-Montréal); this old world Polish restaurant serves up deliciously large plates of weiner schnitzel; peirogi; potato pancakes; pan seared fish; etc.  My weiner schnitzel (veal) was the size of my big head; pounded thin and fried up crisp and buttery.  The sides with it were shredded pickled beets (sweet and tart) and large; buttery wedges of potato.  My companion had pan seared white fish.  There were three very large and meaty fillets; fried up crisp and buttery.  Sides included the potato wedges and a fresh salad with creamy dressing...A lot of people ordered the poppy seed cake; but we were too stuffed to indulge.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,cXciolQyHZiW3uAB_dgPuQ,QaK-b2GLtYuRjl1Il9cqeg,4,My father's birthday was coming up; so as he is Polish; we thought what better place to go; than to Stash for some Polish food. I had not been to the restaurant in a few years and hoped it would be just as good...As soon as you walk in; you are met with that familiarity of having been here before. The piano player is tickling the ivories; the lighting is just bright enough; that each table feels like it is in its own little private area...If you like Polish food or have never tried it; I would highly recommend this place to anyone. There are dishes on the menu; that remind me somewhat of what my grandmother used to make for us...We started off our meal with drinks and being in a Polish restaurant; we started off with a round of Polish vodka; Wyborowa. Nicely chilled and a great way to start off any meal; but I guess any meal that starts with a round of drinks is a nice way to start...We got an assortment of appetizers to start with. A few people got the Flaki soup (a Polish soup made of tripes) and we also got pierogis; plaki; kielbasa; and sledz (herring). On a side note; I don't like herring; however; I decided for the first time to try the one from Stash after my brother convinced me that it is really good. OMG; he was right; I now know what herring should be made like (sorry grandma); but that was really good. What better to have with herring; than vodka; so round two was ordered. Hey; it's a celebration...Three people at the table got the sznycel wiedenski (veal schnitzel); someone got the Bigos (a type of Polish stew); and one golabki (cabbage rolls). There was a lot of sharing and trading of plates and each was excellent; although the golabki could have used a little more salt and the Bigos a little less salt. However; I would recommend either of those dishes in a heart beat. The portions are well sized and quite filling...For dessert we got struddel; although I was surprised that a Polish restaurant didn't have pączki (Polish doughnut). When I asked about it; when making the reservation; the lady told me where I could find them; but I wasn't sure if she meant I could bring them with me or she was just simply being nice and telling me where I could buy them...The meal; with tax and tip (and I was very generous with the tip because our waiter was great) was 308$. That was for 5 meals; 6 entrees; 2 rounds of vodka shots; 2 martinis; bottle of wine; and dessert. In my opinion and of those at the table; it was money well spent.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,GkbaBeSGvt-UmIcefpEARA,ELwPr-GPJwI1UXh5gMjd-A,4,The menu reads: Everything tastes better with wodka -- even wodka...On a Friday night; Stash was filled with young couples on dates and groups of friends meeting for dinner. (Okay; okay; we were a not-so-young couple on a date). Nice ambiance with stone walls; red lanterns; art posters hung from the ceiling; and a piano player giving Madonna and other 80s classics a jazzy twist...The food was well-prepared and servings generous. Not fancy but quite tasty. I've never liked sauerkraut before but; being the brave sort; gave Stash's salade au chou a try. To my surprise; I liked it. ..With a shared appetizer; two mains; two desserts (but no vodka); dinner for two came to about $60 including tax; tip for the waiter; and tip for the piano player...Thanks to other Yelp-ers for the recommendation!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,efG0z9HSoYFRuR3oJoBRxA,5sdk74uFMUlZh-PNxoOZvg,4,We were pleasantly surprised by this charming restaurant!  We have Eastern European roots in our family; and often eat Polish food; so our standards are pretty high. All of their food seemed to be made from scratch and was fresh and flavorful!  We tried the pierogies; potato pancakes; and kielbasa; and the hazelnut cake for dessert. All were delicious! It was also very reasonably priced. Highly recommended!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,0rKQ80I2nw_VDrbHXw6t1Q,czwojApK7aUjG1ubIo6VuA,4,We weren't actually aiming for Stash; but the restaurant down the block was closed mid-afternoon and we were quite hungry.  What a lucky stop!..First - good; prompt service - and they put up with us pronouncing the food names very poorly (except for the pierogis).  We had pierogis and the sweet cream crepes for entrees.  The portions were GREAT.  The pierogis were tender and flavorful - great with the sour cream.  The sweet cream crepes were a great surprise.  I don't know what I was expecting; but they were more savory than sweet - at least until the awesome fruit sauce was added.  Great afternoon meal...Decent belgian beer selection as well.  Definitely will visit again in Montreal.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,QX1UciS9sSwgYoanAPyUFA,N9uWNKyOpudRsMrHnNtISA,4,Darling; warm; and inviting Polish restaurant in the heart of old port Montreal with live music; and helpful staff. ..PROS: delicious food; inviting ambience..CONS: it's a little pricey for what you get..If you're nervous about Polish food or don't know what to order; get the polish sausage dinner; it comes with two sides of your choice and anyone would love it; even picky eaters!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,xkmypny5H5-kFJR2LfbRcw,Hy-E8kwDIYsdw_VdfCT-PA,5,This is fancy Polish food. I've only been to homey; blue collar Polish restaurants in the US. I got my favorite dish; Bigos. It wasn't the best Bigos I've ever had but still really good...They have Zywiec. You should drink that when eating Polish food. :)..There aren't a lot of good; not too overpriced restaurants in Old Montreal; so this is a gem!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,qaWT5E3BX6YKHfrni1HD9w,L00JVclmQq4N3EkzScUC_Q,4,Food was very good.  Had soup; strognow; kielbasa; pierogies all very yummy;  good portions and service was fine.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,bo-H0PMpWW_EGn0H7TwjJA,nQHqCNC_JS17IXNnKQ2UTQ,5,Very delicious food; reasonable price; a little shy but kind employees; the good atmosphere..What else you need. It opened our beautiful weekend with great brunch menus.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,DIuAt2B5lx8Gqj1d529haQ,SDpZowNOQYcBhQrKq1FGfA,5,The food was incredible; the pirogi's were cooked perfectly and the potatoes were tasty.  I loved their beet soup and the kielbasas.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,Af6bR2cp_a06bB0dPkmOkw,gg4Hwwb8wA9_itcSPRBamw,5,Really really good. First time in Montreal and we picked a winner. Filet if Sole was perfect. Some beef and mushroom dish was also great..Piano player was very talented and server was extremely nice. Ambiance good. Location was the best. Go enjoy......
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,WNpl2hrBU_Ep8JgWHu0Ayw,V6I6pI4UymetX7mWOe_l8w,4,A lucky find in Montreal. We were walking by and saw this place. It looked interesting and we liked the menu..Borsch was bad since it tasted as if it was from a can. But holidnik; golubci and the rest was incredibly tasty. Atmosphere was warm and welcoming! Staff was courteous and attentive. All the food was delicious and fresh (except for borsch).
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,sCX1B3wXzZjT1wy3vyktgA,QqU_rJM619UVZKtrvSubPg,4,Vegetarian heaven in old Montreal!!! My girlfriend and i orderd potato pancakes and crepe roll filled with mushroom and they were both yummy  the wait time was high but it was totally worthy. We didn't get to try the drinks but the bar counter sis look cool.. oh; I almost forgot to mention the dip alongside the crepe; it was fantastic and so fresh. Also; the price is pretty decent for fine food
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,Bh244FMioJ70-XOPcZ4pmQ,HcFZno5I_1Zo5svob1vhlg,5,Great place to grab dinner. The service was great and very friendly and we got food very quickly; which was especially important since we were starving. The food was great and tasted very fresh; I know my fair share about Polish/East European food and I have to say a lot of places don't do it justice; this  place does; so that's saying a lot and for a fair price. This is a place you should surely check out in you're in the area. Yum!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,fSPvk0Z_9eWm2kkUvhDJeg,sTfbY1i8oZHqSrBFjZ3N9A,4,So why go to a Polish restaurant while visiting Montreal? Well if it has great reviews; looks really inviting; and if it happens to be snowing and freezing outside (like it was when we went); then I think those are good enough reasons...Actually I had one of the more distinctive soups that I've ever had at this restaurant; hence the four stars. I've looked everywhere but I really haven't found a place here in the Bay Area that could duplicate the zurek soup (sour rye malt soup) I had here. Simply wonderful.....Sure the sausages and pierogies were great as well; but on a cold winter's day that soup is what I remember most.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,oqNju0BSMCrIEGOYirhpgg,-BCIWoYtGs2ngewZyT5Kgw,4,The cabbage pierogi are sooooo incredible ... delicate and delicious!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,Tz7liunijk8INJQWQGW7Cg,GMzqCuBTsiXTy6S-7YToZw,5,We stopped by Stash after visiting Notre Dame. It is a short walk for scrumptious Polish food...We enjoyed and shared leak soup (packed with many veggies); potato pancakes; beef/mushroom stroganoff; beet salad; beef-cheese-dumplings; and sauerkraut. .It was soooo good! I wholeheartedly recommend it.
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,SisbjmC3RGETDw4dzLDCYw,8JlJq7z_uwgvbTuV-NY7hg,5,My family used to live in a very multicultural neighbourhood in Toronto; and there were a high number of eastern European immigrants. My mom would cook me a lot of the food from there like cabbage rolls; pierogies; and stuffed Hungarian peppers...I was super excited to see that they had the former two on the menu at Stash Cafe and ordered them. They tasted like my childhood. Would definitely recommend!
Dl3ty7Rt2WeBIAUoBF0EXg,82vSXGC55BOPssPCs5ea4w,Lsps8IgEbjz9BJ_Y7MQLOg,5,If you're looking for tasty authentic Polish comfort food; this is the place to visit...They have homemade pierogi; bigos; flaki; and much much more (don't  forget to order a shot of Wyborowa; it's how a good meal is supposed to start)...It's very affordable and located in old Montreal; so you can go stroll around after your dinner and enjoy this beautiful area.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,fENhF1F6I9c2ssnkfprYzw,BLmwrmeM1cPVrvha26HQCg,4,It has become a Montreal tradition to eat here and shoot my blood sugar levels to alarming levels; a tradition that I definitely enjoy. My family (mom and sister) came here at 10:30 on a Saturday night. The place was fairly empty; with the exception of a couple of tables. The hostesses were sweet and spoke English to us the second I announced Je ne parle pas Francais; which is the  end of my extensive French vocabulary. We ordered the white and dark chocolate fondue sharing plate with fruits; brownie; and waffle bits. The waffle bids provided were barely anything; but the fruits (apples; bananas; and pineapples) were chopped up and served nicely; and were more than enough. We also ordered the chocolate and marshmallow pizza to go; which was absolutely delicious; if you could get past the initial sugar shock. All in all it was a delightful experience as always; the only reason I'm taking a star off is because the waffle bits provided were very few; which really is unacceptable for the price range.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,Ea3zkTaYttlZSGqWukjJRg,2g18JhQyv0ktXbD-D-gnrA,3,We stopped for dessert prior to the airport. Place was very cute. We were only one of two tables there at the time. There were only two workers. We were sat down quickly but it took a while before our orders were taken. At this point I should probably have a disclaimer that I was in Paris a few months ago so I may be biased. The hot chocolate was thick and rich. You can tell they melted good quality chocolate. It was super pricey though. My cup of hot chocolate was $10 (Canadian dollar) plus extra for marshmallow. My husband's crepe was just ok. After we were done with desserts; we also had to wait a while before we got our checks as the waitress was playing with her phone.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,kIg_NLZg_Z3t1BxmsFfpyA,VMtPj8lvVZRpeWnhtbhbMg,1,What a disappointment.  We got there to find that the only server wasn't there yet. We had to wait like 20 minutes until she finally arrived. There was only another table and ours( bad sign; the place was almost empty ).We finally got our food which was ok. ( looked much better in the pictures) then when we were ready to pay ; they had a problem taking credit cards.  I had to pay cash with the only cash I had on me.  The server got upset because I didn't tip her. Guess what?  i just had to spend all my cash paying the check because I couldn't use my credit card. What a joke!   Never again.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,Ao1fWpdW5DhGBIIcu7nVKg,Jc3pVG_TztX2Me-plwlV9Q,1,"We wanted to order takeout as my 85 year old father in law was worn out from a day of walking around Montreal. So our plan was for my wife to order takeout while my son and I walked there.  Turns out the employee hung up on my wife when she tried to explain why she wanted to order.  (I learned this when I got home.)  So we enter the restaurant and I said my wife called in an order and the guy rolled his eyes and said no and walked away.  I realize my phone is buzzing and my wife just texted me what happened and texted our order to me.  So unhappily we will start from scratch...Several minutes later the guy comes back and says well do you want to order and I say yes and then say but I'm still confused why you can't take an order with a credit card and he says because people like you won't show up.  I couldn't figure out if he meant American or Anglo or something else...So I go to read the order from my phone and he simply walks away again.  We go through this two more times (and I got stern...my kids call it daddy tone) and he does the same rude thing...asking if I want to order but walking away when I try. And he kept calling us names under his breath. We definitely heard Jesus...f*@king a@@holes.  The other is far more offensive based upon the religion he perceived us to be but I will leave that out since we are not positive he said it.  (Ill give him the benefit of the doubt.)..I then called the Atwater location to see if we can do takeout from there. The employee there said we could but said I should talk to the manager at the Parc location. The same rude guy at Parc said there is no manager; I ask for the manager's name so the next day I can send an email.  He says he won't give out the name of the manager because it is private.  I said first name is fine if there is a concern.  He said I'm not giving it to you.  The staff does not wear name tags and he wouldn't give his name either.   We left and went to the Atwater location to get our takeout.  (I gave them a five star review.  Great staff.)..I think Cacao 70 has an issue on its hands.  Given the diversity of the neighborhood around Parc and Montreal as a whole I think they want to be careful with the offensive prejudices of the staff and the treatment of customers.
zrTGcb83AsfyVTMrsCa65A,LM8DUtnuc-57Rn8tQPPwjw,25DATGmWSIvq3tKQ5Rv9dQ,3.0,Apparently; this place is only hot when a game is on.  I came here on a Saturday night around 10:30pm and there were only 5 other patrons.  The place is huge; so it looked even more pathetic than it sounds.  ..I got the Kilt Lifter Scottish Ale; a locally brewed amber beer that was quite flavorful and not too bitter.  They have a good selection of beers on tap including imports and domestic.  I had already eaten dinner; so I didn't attempt to indulge in the Big Unit; but checked out the menu just for yuks.  Quite a variety of options and most meals seem to be named after a certain person.  Cute touch.  But no assignment of credit for who inspired the big unit.....All the staff here have black teardrops ala Alice Cooper.  Lots of guitars on the walls and three HUGE TV screens above the bar.  Outdoor seating and music blasting in and outside...Thanks to Jim B. for the recommendation to come here.  It gave me conversation fodder :)
SThmy10YhS13oFgT990Xhw,ll4LNJOgESRe1OAz-khLyQ,Lw9NQ1B14gI-an7BriVG3Q,3.0,In a quaint neighborhood of brick homes comes a Northern Europe mojo from the young lady with blonde hair and waffle patience; from the rack of Belgian waffles; and the Indie rock playing at a tasteful level.  The ideal place for reading the newspaper and watching a couple across the street play frisbee with their kid at 8:39 am.  I finished my basic Belgian waffle at light speed and I am going to leave before I put on sweatpants and make a fool out of myself.  It's good Belgian for a good price.
dQAcT0i8dqlzK5YMa1bWDQ,41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,PxkVDVRKFgrmnvCDrxYz-Q,3.0,I must say this place has probably the best selection of Quebec Artisan food you can find fresh; in a bottle; box or jar from all corners of the province.  The selection here really is outstanding.  ..Where I find challenging about this Marche however is the pricing.  I looked at a few bottles of jam and some were $8.50 or $9.  Really?  $9 for blueberry jam?  Methinks not for this guy.  I can understand if it's in an airport and also in Newfoundland bakeapple jam is more but I find this gouging!  When in the US (or Toronto) I visit Whole Foods.  This I use as the upper echelon of pricing in which I believe is fair to pay for some goods.  Even at Whole foods some of their products are way expensive.  I do know Marche Des Saveurs is a small business but I find their pricing INSANE for what they charge!..Great goods!  Pricing is like you are at the general store in Inuvik!!!

35ET2yviSxhkMmQa89rFKA,tWBLn4k1M7PLBtAtwAg73g,zPczJOkZSkvqBbI-WZJV8w,3.0,The Jersey Giant is one of the more un-assuming places in this area of town. It's a pretty low key pub with decent food and a nice selection of beers on tap..Pitchers are under $20 for import or premium brands; and the food is all decently priced and pretty good as well. I've enjoyed the nachos on numerous occasions; and the Cubano sandwich is quite good. Pork tenderloin with bacon and avocado sauce on a bun; tasty stuff indeed. Last time I had wings and ribs and it was along the standard pub quality...The front half is more dining area; typical tables and chairs; middle of the room has a good sized bar; and then in the back by the bathrooms there is a small room with a pool table; dart board; and jukebox. There is also a small patio out front that seats a couple small tables; but like most downtown patios; the real estate fills up quick. ..While this place is unpolished and not really an impressive place at first glance; it is good for some lunch or even after work drinks if you're not looking for something with the corporate stiffness associated at most of the other places in the area; which is pretty much the main reason I keep coming back.

1YQaI6yyWa8jSzP0jJX0tw,1Z8g8lyU6ILsItOKJmJmxQ,xUwGuHwJjX44XgxCDiIGEA,2.0,Since I've been seeing signs claiming that Capriotti's was voted the world's greatest sandwich I decided to give it a try.  I decided to order an Italian sandwich.  First of all; I was a little sticker shocked...they don't have a combo meal so a medium sandwich; drink and chips came out to about $12.00--yowzers!  Secondly; I was the only customer for a good 10 minutes (it was 5pm on a Thursday) and my sandwich took FOREVER to get done.. maybe I'm use to Jimmy Johns and Subway.  I got mine to go and was very disappointed to find out when I got home that they gave me the WRONG sandwich.  How do you f-up an order when it's the only customer in the restaurant?  I even double checked my receipt to make sure I ordered the one I wanted.  Instead of an Italian I got some leftover Thanksgiving ensemble.  Well; this Yelper only eats stuffing on Thanksgiving and doesn't eat cranberry sauce or mayo at all.. I was so irate I gave the entire thing to my dog..hopefully he won't get sick.
c-Ur4wPDNjt-e2N5MkRRaQ,LrQgh9Xt8EZPBaAm_L8x3A,xPEzgTYIviiZkVGAwiojmQ,2.0,Unless you have a stomach the size of a golfball or you're extremely bored and have so much cash to burn that you're literally burning it during your downtime; DO NOT GO TO CHALAU...Seriously; save yourself the overhwleming sadness and disappointment you will feel when your meal is brought to you and you wonder if you've gone blind; because the portion sizes are so small you can't see it.  Okay; obviously this is an exaggeration; you can see it; but the sadness and disappointment will still be there. ..My co-workers tried to warn me; but my stubborness and lack of good dim sum options in the yonge/college area persuaded me to go.  Sadly I did not go alone; I had to take a good friend down with me for the most miserable dinning experience ever.  We left confused and extremely unsatisfied...My favorite dish : fried chicken taro dumplings were smaller than golfballs.  The young chow fried rice came in a bowl that you is used to hold gravy at Thanksgiving dinners.  The only thing that was served in a manner that I was used to was the Nestea that I ordered.  Thankfully they did not manage to shrink the cans.  But everything else was miniature.  I did not feel like I had dinner; just really over-priced appetizers.  The bill came to about $31.58 for 6 dishes; but again I stress; that they were super tiny dishes.  I cannot believe they have the audacity to smile at me while serving me food made for tiny people.  Oh and the hovering......so annoying.  I can't go to anymore chinese restaurants; where the employees are so afraid of losing their job that they eyeball you during your whole meal so they can rush over and remove your dish as soon as you finish with it or even before in some cases; anything to look busy and useful; pleasing their employer and pissing off the customers. ..This could also explain why the place was empty when we walked in.  I chalked it up to the fact that it's a Thursday night or maybe word had not spread yet; or maybe it had and that's why all the empty seats. ..Chalau; you need to spend less money on decor and more money on the food.  I don't care if you serve me with paper plates on plastic table coverings (love these btw); just don't mini-size my dim sum.  You've got the quality down pat (oh yes; I should mention everything was fresh; but fresh air would have been just as satisfying and free); just unshrink the food; lower your prices and your business will bloom.

Ordered the tom yum soup and it was so salty we had to ask for 2 cups of hot water to dilute it. The free shrimp chips are stale. The fried calamari tasted frozen with a non crispy thin batter. Do not get me started with the pad Thai.. Why was it sweet???

OFnDWBP8iXxgeBrfHA5fRA,A6CflYJQPTwRX14HuWr2aQ,A_fBhm9au6HRkg44_Ro7Jw,4.0,Four queens is a budget friendly old Vegas style hotel. You get the old school glitz and glam feel along with the ability to frequent freemont street and a few other hotels and casinos in the area. The front desk staff is friendly; and helpful. Honestly the entire staff was. The Wi-Fi is 8.99 for 24 hours which kind of sucks; but honestly it's 9 bucks it's not that bad. The lobby and casino.are packed full of lights and different things to look at. The restaurants like the subway are open 24 hours. There are a few restaurants inside the hotel; we tried 2 during our stay. The Chicago style pizza place which had excellent staff; and the pizza is really good. The drinks are cheap as well; although of you're playing the casino you drink for free. .There is also magnolias and hugos. Magnolias is not that great in my opinion. The hostess is very friendly; as is the rest of the staff. The food is subpar and the menu is small. I didn't try hugos  but I heard good things. .There is a lot of smokers in this hotel; so be warned. The rooms are decent rooms; nothing ng too over the top but good solid 3 star rooms. The showers are good and have extra body jets in them. The beds are comfortable; and the views are nice the higher up you go. I recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to stay on freemont; or just looking for a budget friendly location.

If you are a sports fanatic and enjoy watching a good game then this is your place. What I don't like is the discrepancy in wing prices between the boneless wings and the regular ones...I really think that's a bunch of crap...I don't care if the boneless wings are cheaper; I just don't like them. I much prefer the regular ones as they are much more full of flavor. Anyway; it's my opinion and I'm sticking to it!

Happy hour beers are reasonable; $2 for a pint $3.50 for a mug.  I was scared to try any food here because of the previous reviews; so i got an order of tater tots - it's pretty hard to mess these up.  They weren't bad; and the bar is pretty cool.  I'd recommend more decorations or a theme.  If the food gets better this place could be my new local bar!

AV6weBrZFFBfRGCbcRGO4g,9rCC5EgM6EN21f78SPS8AA,qW9GCgfy2x7WO8lr9Tq8Mw,2.0,We got a nice room deal to stay here for 3 nights in the summer of 2009; and paid to upgrade to a suite.  We were disappointed and underwhelmed.  It was a corner suite; so it was at the edge where 2 sides of the pyramid converged; and the suite seemed huge but filled with useless and wasted space.  A few pieces of mismatched furniture were scattered in the room; but there were vast sections that were empty; and not in a tasteful and stylish way; more like a why the heck is all this space there; it looks lost and scary way.  The rooms were dark; very dark; and all that extra dark space was depressing and moody.  It didn't smell very pleasant either; more musty and dank rather than fresh and clean.  I suppose if what they wanted was to get us OUT of the room and into the casino; they succeeded; but we didn't gamble in the Luxor hardly at all so they probably didn't succeed in the way they hoped.  The bed was comfortable enough; and the bathroom was large but without sufficient towels.  And what was up with the huge klunky old CRT televisions in the suite??  Are they planning to upgrade to the late 20th century any time soon?  The whole place seems sad and dark and tired; we couldn't wait to leave the Luxor each morning to go somewhere else to gamble.  (And if they think Carrot Top is a draw; they should think again; we made oh barf faces every time we caught sight of an ad for his show.)..For the price we didn't complain; but we won't be staying at the Luxor again.  Unless it's for free.  :-)

Their shaved ice wasn't really anything special. I grade kind of hard here because I was able to try some amazing shaved ice back in Irvine; CA. It was ACTUALLY shaved ice. But that's not for me to talk about in this review...Their shaved ice was just chunks and bits of ice. Didn't really like the red bean on it either. This was; I guess; average/mediocre. Nothing you'd ever go craving for. Our waitress was nice and friendly though. We got checked up on and she was at refilling our waters even though we didn't need anymore; haha...I'll drop by for some food in the near future and update my review accordingly :).
e6d50rwRTU-fONeSBJmOHQ,Zx5_M5JxqEy83RXdCQ3i7Q,vHxvCdyHY1TjttZYFFS01w,2.0,I love ramen and this place is close to home; so have it a shot. First; steamed buns were awesome!! Tropical black tea was great. Green tea was just green colored water. I ordered the pork ramen and my bf ordered the vegetarian ramen. It came out and pretty instantly we knew it was going to be sub par. The noodles tasted like they were opening up ramen packs in the back. The broth was very generic and tasted like it was dumped from a can 10 minutes earlier. The egg had no flavor. His vegetation broth had a burnt plastic taste to it. $60 later and we left pretty unhappy. The ambiance; the service and the cleanliness was on point. But won't be returning. We'll keep going to Tampopo Ramen in Tempe.
4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg,0ZR-0Yqbr6H47guxXMBy0w,4LVxmJAP89wF17fsJW37LQ,4.0,The ramen here is amazing. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is always friendly. It's a small place so it does fill up quickly during the normal rush times for lunch and dinner. They have Kirin on draft and sake if you like it. Don't ask for lemon in your water; they don't have any. The water is filtered so it's fine without it. If you want your ramen extra spicy order a side of the killer spicy meat.

Everyone was friendly! We came on a busy Saturday night; the hostess had told us it would be a half hour (which only ended up being about 15 minutes); we sat at the bar while waiting for a table & the bartender & drinks were great! Our server was fantastic and friendly (and fast); our food came out very quickly and everything was delicious! We will definitely be back & we have already told lots of ppl!
0ML-qyU4P6LmoV-O2NRQuQ,CFB9glegliFCT7dJxdLNsA,xVm0tgCqN_ZyTzpgA_RtDw,3.0,Halal Peri Peri long time awaited ! The menu is very diversified and they offer multiple choices of marination for the chicken ! For those who do not like anything spicy i recommend the lemon/herb seasoning ! The food is good; great place for a group as the offer family platters ! They also do catering and ive personally experienced it ! In restaurant i believe they can do a little better in the presentation of the food ! Dont get me wrong the skewer on your plate is very unique and original but when it come to the chicken something is missing; for example the chiken can be served on a bed of fries instead of just having chicken on one plate and the fries on the other (just feels boring and overcrowds the table) imagine the juice from the seasoning of the chicken over your fries ! How much tastier those chips will be :)!!!

After I finished the errand I was running; I decided to make a quick stop to try something. ..The Ube Monster was a deliciously sweet milkshake with added cookie crumbs. I also tried their ube madeleine which is additionally covered in an ube frosting swirl. ..Everything was amazing; but definitely not the kind of thing I'd order frequently. I am only giving minus a star because it felt like I had to wait quite a while for my order.

Staff will find any reason to yell and make noise; whether it's a customer entering or leaving; or a dish comes out of the kitchen; or anything else. Definitely the kind of atmosphere that encourages you to raise your own voices...If you're not a fan of the volume; fortunately they also have a patio that is much quieter. During colder seasons; it would be covered up and adequately heated; so the option is available year-round as long as they choose to offer it...We came for some mega karaage. I don't know if it's on the regular menu; but they make some pretty good fried chicken. Super crisp skin; nice juicy meat. They have a waiter checking up on the patio frequently enough; with water refills and asking how things are doing...I don't know how the regular items are like; but if they've got karaage normally I'd come back for more.

They make their drinks really strong; but no complaints on that front. The only thing that's consistently annoying is the SUPER LOUD mariachi. Sounds great from 20 feet away; but way too loud when they are right next to your table. We will be back; trying to avoid the live mariachi

I love the subtle lighting throughout the entire restaurant. ..Service: Our waitress was really nice. The food came out rather quickly; and there wasn't much to complain about from that regard. ..Food: This is where things take a turn... The food was..ok. There was nothing that wowed me with the meal; but nothing that sucked either. I ordered a chicken teriyaki dish.. It came on a bed of raw onions... What...? That's so bizarre; I wasn't sure what the purpose of those onions were; but no thank you. I wish the amount of effort that went into designing the restaurant went into designing the menu. ..This place is ok; but just ok. There are far superior hibachi style restaurants in the area.

or4UVDjXEEjze3wNPjoAZA,M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA,yrHWhlV1vmkXDpgBXgCCAA,3.0,09/23/10..My first of two Restaurant Week 2010 experiences began at Zinc Bistro.  Let me preface that I took Mom w/ me; and it was this meal's experience that I have learned never to take her to a place that ranks higher than a moderate in terms of costs.  It doesn't matter that she's not the one paying; and I refuse to let someone; not even my mother; dissuade me from enjoying a great meal!..We'd arrived 30 minutes before dinner service; and Mom was already hungry.  I tried stalling for about 15 minutes; looking over the off-hour menu for something for her to nibble on.  (We also found it difficult to flag down someone to help us during our stay here; even though it wasn't busy!)  I decided I'd get her the open-faced Zinc Burger; which was listed at $13.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=MgpZeM3N2f8wi6EuEbjd3A#MgpZeM3N2f8wi6EuEbjd3A  The menu didn't list a side dish accompanying it; so I asked our server if there were any fries or salad that came w/ it.  No was the answer.  This angered my Mom; who did not wish for me to pay $13 for just a burger.  She only had the ambience (of which she thought wasn't great) and the arrogance of our server to go on; I knew of Chef Matt Carter's reputation; as well as Chef Beau MacMillan's endorsement of the best French onion soup (at Zinc Bistro) he's ever tasted on Food Network's episode of Best Thing I Ever Ate: Cheesy.  Those 25 minutes waiting for the burger to arrive were the longest 25 minutes I've ever experienced in my life; no exaggeration!  Thank God that when the burger finally did arrive; that it was a VERY tasty burger!  Of course; she wouldn't admit this to me.  No... I only learnt of her approval when our server had asked us later on if we were enjoying our food-- a very enthusiastic yes was her reply!..My restaurant week meal thus followed: ..1st course: Smoked Scottish salmon tartare- green apple; creme fraiche; and toasted brioche.  A truly lovely dish to gaze at; and even more wonderful to taste!  I loved the texture of the salmon- very creamy; and the cubed hard-boiled eggs added some fun mouth-feel!  This dish made me think I was eating salmon sushi w/o the rice!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=z--Qcv88vRbjCa_KUDY7Hw#z--Qcv88vRbjCa_KUDY7Hw..2nd course: Seared Ahi Tuna- preserved lemon creamy orzo; roasted beet; and fennel.  Another winner!  Great presentation-- seared ahi tuna chunks; w/ red centers atop wonderfully creamy orzo (Mom's first time trying orzo... she loved it!); with a beet reduction glazing the dish.  Really enjoyed the meaty tuna chunks; which tasted fresh-from-the-sea and not fishy at all.  Again; the orzo added great texture contrast to the meaty fish-- I enjoyed this dish so much; I had the leftovers for breakfast the next day! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=SHDk_-fvZRXr4O82qOEKFg#SHDk_-fvZRXr4O82qOEKFg..3rd course: Apple Tart Tatin Brown Butter Caramel; which really wasn't a tart tatin.  It wasn't even a pie; which was a bit disappointing.  It consisted of a cake that looked like angel cake but had the texture of a pound cake; apple-flavored; and quite dry.  Not even the brown butter caramel sauce nor the house-made ice cream could save it. :( [I was told it was either a cream cheese; sour cream; or buttermilk- based; but all I tasted was vanilla.]  My favorite components of this dessert were the three; caramelized and very thin-sliced pieces of apple.  We also enjoyed the French-pressed coffee; which also came w/ one piece of biscotti each; that I chose to accompany this tart tatin.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=M8rhOQyLbDHHNTSq7nF6gw#M8rhOQyLbDHHNTSq7nF6gw.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=sXKSvx7P8pLPKLeZPdLHeQ#sXKSvx7P8pLPKLeZPdLHeQ..4 stars overall for the food; and less than 3 stars for the arrogance and absenteeism of our server and for the ambience.  (We didn't like the flow of the rooms: the tables were too close to each other; and while there was a lovely mini-Eiffel Tower on display; on its base sat containers filled w/ artificial sweeteners- a bit tacky; I thought.)  ..I wouldn't mind ordering the Zinc burger again; but please add a side dish to it!  And lose the arrogant servers.  Unless; of course; they have sexy French accents to go along w/ their dispositions!  (Pa dum dum!)
hF1-dtY_oXfngC8h2mY4qg,MJaPNkuYJL0AOIuA7qaHgQ,sfgEXPhsTpd4F4nxxi3fiA,5.0,Great service and food; their lobster mac and cheese was awesome. The view is amazing
t2O4Qx74U_IfBzDHJzvUCA,H3VsV3rm86qipND8Vj56Mw,TWNZKlByDiAQSEfmKgrwCQ,3.0,Very cool concept; hip environment; great menu selections; and good service all around - however; the kitchen does not live up to expectations.  The restaurant concept itself is a very good idea - farm to table menu (with a focus on grilled steaks) in a contemporary setting.  Several larger table seating options for larger parties.  The restaurant offers a wide selection of cuts of steak to meet any preference.  They do offer several grass fed steak options which is a bonus and not common in the food scene in Cleveland.  ..For appetizer; we ordered the cocktail shrimp - although this is a different take on the traditional shrimp cocktail; it was not anything too unique.  For the main entree; we decided to go with the New York Strip steak sample; which is basically strip steak from 3 types of beef - one grass fed; one corn fed; and another dry aged.  Personally; I think this would be a good dish to share amongst 2 people as the quantity is perfect for 2 individuals and additionally; you can order a different cook for each of the steaks; so if your partner enjoys a more well done cook and you like medium rare - this would be possible as these are separate cuts.  The recommendation here would be to get the grass fed beef cuts medium to medium rare as these tend to be less fatty.  For those who like medium well or well done; would recommend the more traditional corn fed cuts of meat.  The cook of the meat was on point; however; we did not feel the quality of the steak for the price point and additionally was not a big fan of the seasoning.  We also ordered the grilled cauliflower and sauteed mushrooms as sides - both were above average.   ..Overall; no huge complaints for the restaurant; however; the food provided by the kitchen did not meet the expectations based on the with the restaurant environment or price point.  The restaurant definately has potential - the menu is on point and environment is great - just need to get the food amped up.
966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,W52s1slej7wQJWNC15h_bw,3Mq4J3SHhDnrYJw_vU4zkA,1.0,This restaurant was so disappointing! It was terrible! The food was so gross it turned my stomach. The service was terrible. Server never checked on us once; the manager stopped by when we flagged her down and told her about our nasty food and she acted as if she didn't care. We also got 2 Thai teas......they were the worst teas I have ever had! I did not like anything about this restaurant! Please save your money!!!!!!!!
-Qkx7W0itbAApcG5lJuMFQ,rhBT5AQi8LPTc3Mk2Qpxpw,H-EnEZ9fEHQJtrRnbZ6K3w,5.0,This place was life changing. Raw; fresh sushi IN A BURRITO!! Geniuses. Omg. It's a really cool place for a quick bite. You pick out what you want and what kind of paper you want it wrapped in. It's like a hand roll out of control. One is def enough per person. Upgrade to the meal and you get a drink; soup or edamame or a few other sides. DELISH! We went twice when we were there in July. Can't wait to go back!! It is located in the Linq Promenade across from Sprinkles cupcakes. So much to do down in that area- don't miss it!
xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw,NwPnvTALYMNZgdiwHHkuAQ,eUNkyAAgy_nHrCKlKUjqZw,5.0,To quote the four year old who joined me on my recent visit to The Fry Bread House; I like it so much I'd like to eat here every day for forever. My sentiment exactly; although the caloric level of the food would probably not allow it. Limited to a dozen tables; none of which seats more than four; you place your order at the counter and wait for your name to be called.  No worries.  The fare is not the type that demands a high priced decor and table service.  A different type of service is evident. A three time a week regular joined the line behind me and was presented with his food without even having to place his order.  Impressive.  ..The menu is far more diverse than just fry bread covered with honey or powdered sugar; although you will probably want to have some for dessert.  Fry bread is also utilized in a wide variety of combinations of beans; beef; pork and chile; with recipes rooted in the tribal traditions of the Tohono O'odham.  And the desserts include a killer chocolate concoction. Our table seemed to love anything that included green chile.  The children's entrees were reasonably priced ($4.25 including drink) and include a tasty open fry bread covered with melted cheese and small fry bread diskettes intended to be dipped in refried beans. ..While a regular loyal clientele seems to dominate those present on most days; the restaurant is a great choice for visitors to Arizona interested in sampling a superior quality fry bread and some genuinely regional cuisine. Native American crafts are often on sale outside the restaurant; adding to the experience...Good news for fans of The Fry Bread House:  the restaurant will soon be moving to a larger location 17 blocks down Indian School Road (1003 E. Indian School Road).
muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw,fR4hq0UlIpp4lDXKxmHhGw,OKdw_yqeMpYssTgWke7r1g,2.0,Based on such nice comments through yelpers; me n my family decided to give it a try. We went for the dinner. Ordered nihari; mixed grilled platter and the chicken karahi. It was not a busy day but still twice they brought us someone else's order. They were not sure who ordered it. Shows lack of good customer's service skills. Well not a big deal. When our order came out........it was not what we excepted. The chicken karahi was more like curry chicken; chicken boti was inedible bcoz of being toooo salty; rice was bland; and nihari had 5 to 6 hard & tiny pieces which seemed like been boiled & put in the curry. Only thing we liked was seekh kabob. The taste of food was average. It might be just a bad day I hope. Will give it another try. What we really enjoyed was a nice chat with the young guy who was so helpful n friendly.
hRL_qCrcu9UL773su0QabQ,-tTVsQTMRB3GwurrX67D-w,fiInUq9_o-qD-umS6dbGvw,3.0,So we came here on a Saturday night at 8ish for dinner before a movie. Hostess told us 20-30 minutes....ended up being over an hour. We wouldn't have waited except there was live music outside and we had a spot near a fireplace. Our server; Dillon; was really nice. Made a point to find out if we were waiting long; even though it wasn't his fault...place was busy. Food is okay... Tempura - standard; poke was pretty good. I think they topped the shishito peppers with bonito flakes; which I didn't like too much. Rolls were ok. I really like spicy tuna rolls; so if a place doesn't get that right; it's all downhill for me. Not likely to go just for kabuki; but if I happen to be at Tempe marketplace; and I want sushi... Guess I don't have a choice
i4Jb_b28YAphS9_jPPzwkQ,MD8nhQkHlRtulzPwDOdlcA,VCAeSH5FFC9c31caQU7oyw,5.0,The quality and service at Italian Spoon have never been less than 5 stars for us; and we have been using them for years.  We ordered a few days in advance online for my daughter's birthday that was at a bring your own food wine and beer place.  They were on time; the food was hot and they brought everything I needed to serve.  ..This is the only place I know that serves shrimp and chips as well as pasta. The shrimp are always good sized and the food is always hot and appetizing.  We have ordered from Italian Spoon for delivery for several years; and we've been inside the actual restaurant.  This is our go-to delivery when we don't want pizza.
ZZF5iqlKFBWJSGSZzWHMzA,oV6h4n33PBH0cs5M3FIuKg,yXIv26dKqrNlzCItJ8PMnQ,4.0,Good Asian fusion right in the heart of Chinatown. I came here with a friend on a Tuesday night. We decided to try a few of the following menu items:..- Pork belly steamed bao: Decent pork belly bao. It reminded me of the Banhi boys one; which makes sense as the restaurants share owners. .- Hambaoger: Presented like a hamburger; this is a mini Big Mac only with the buns replaced with fluffy steamed white baos. Personally I thought there was a lot of excess oil was dripping from the burger while I was eating it; but overall it was quite tasty. .- Korean popcorn chicken: A plate of small balls of deep fried chicken; this dish was quite heavy with nothing to balance it out. We regretted not ordering a bowl of steamed rice to balance out all these intense flavours. It felt like having a traditional Chinese dinner without your own bowl of rice! .- Side of eggplant: This was shockingly spicy; which further supported why we needed to a side of rice for balance..- Tuna tostata: Very small tuna tostadas - the tostada was crispy and oily but I liked the tuna on top. For $3; it was not a lot of food; just a very small tapa. ..Overall great food and service. If you are looking for more of a sit down atmosphere compared to Banh Mi Boys; this is the perfect place as Lucky Red is an extension of the Asian fusion trend there.
XcQKsEUlh1W0R4iXbTA1Yg,MVwvI9me0GQ31FkjIwDx6g,3ivs6ppPBpfKle_EDF_SYg,5.0,Stopped in here after visiting the Christmas Story house (a brief drive but not within walking distance).  Really enjoyed the food.  Had a late lunch and we were the only two people in the restaurant.  Ordered a doner kebab; lamb sauté and some grape leaves.  Had a draft beer and glass of wine.  Waiter and staff were very friendly.
9yESUcIVarhYEabIMj844Q,QC1lJZ1HmW0ggKm-5dtVHg,JegZwMxZ4CTKyUwajYfZAw,4.0,This place is awesome. I moved from Arizona in August and I was happy to leave. I did not know that AZ was capable of a fun place to hang. I love the concept of the yard attached to the restaurant. You can play shuffle board; ping pong; corn hole; and/or chat. This place brings the outdoors inside.

Being new to Arizona it's hard finding restaurants that the whole family can enjoy.  They're friendly and helpful. They have business and I will be referring my friends too

OFnDWBP8iXxgeBrfHA5fRA,lhJzNM8Hjy4Nn3-eQETEwg,d38ARbk5P5k-MUiTLEkdcw,2.0,This rating is specifically for their rooms. I liked the casino; and their restaurants. However their rooms are pretty dingy. The shower was a little gnarly and the toilet flush was very weak. The rooms are extremely inexpensive; so I guess we got what we paid for. But I think it's worth the extra money to stay at a nicer place like the golden nugget.

b6Rv6vwJPaMAQGuSsqPPPQ,vY-fJj01AmX929GweBKolw,f47Ubwk_9cIoUWeunxNg_w,2.0,pho east open in the location that use to be pho house.  pho house moved across the street. From the outside and inside; its probably the best looking pho restaurant in east chinatown.  that is where it all goes down south. Tea is not free; i was wondering why they didn't bring me tea when i first arrived.  chopsticks; spoons; tissue was not readily available like the other restaurants where it is so convenient just to grab your own.  pho noodles was only 1 size... me and the kids ate the same size... i wanted extra large; they wanted small; we both got large... how was the pho? nothing really special; especially not special enough to make me pay for tea... no beef balls in the beef noodle special. overall disappointed.  Staff was friendly; but with so many pho places offering more; if they don't change; they will struggle because the locals will not come.
3sOS8wKatd_Uoa9VEJHhrw,PK_uJG5QjfL7dNzdbg4OPQ,WI--kgsyU0w01oLiLzJOrQ,4.0,Never would've found this place if it wasn't for Yelp...Big; delicious sandwiches.  We bought a whole pecan pie.  I prefer pecan pie to have more pecans throughout but the flavor was pretty fantastic.  Potato salad was good and mustardy.  Cole slaw was good.  Service was excellent.  Great meal.
w2gXToEf9ba78Qfmp42YRQ,VXl5CIETMGXIaJVExVxPNw,DnXY_vaQx_2-sPtcommPzA,1.0,I went through the drive-thru. My boyfriend ordered 2 twelve pieces nuggets and 2 large fries and a cookie. We proceed to go through and I checked the receipt and said (before food came back out the window) I didn't order this. The girl with the braces at the window got the manager over; Spencer. Spencer said that the refund process was very complicated and long and that he couldn't do it tonight; but assured us the GM could do it tomorrow. He told me he could ONLY give me coupons to makeup for THEIR mistake.... (saying we had 2 12 pieces and 2 large fries when really they charged us for 4 12 pieces) I said no. I didn't want it the nuggets they charged us for. I didn't want anything else for that matter; i was disgusted. I work in food and how this was handled was ridiculous. So the next day; we call for the GM and talk to another guy. He heard us out and was a lot better than Spencer. Later; the GM called us and asked us what she could do after lots of hoops to jump through. We took her the receipt and are now waiting for our refund which takes NINE business days: Spencer seemed very irritated and inconvenienced and didn't give two shits about helping us. And then to top it all the food was cold and the cookie was so hard I didn't even eat it; just threw it in the bag.  The customer service here sucks and as soon as I get my refund; I'll never be back to this location; go to Canes right down the street; they actually have great customer service and care about their customers.
DysR74Xdr8P88i-ealNHKQ,ObqVg5hj-OzGfP2obqBzlw,_WP5riYP7ia_9p1YT0o8yg,4.0,I was really surprised by the donuts here. They are smaller than regular donuts; but better than regular donuts. Wayyyyy better in fact. ..As I walked up; I could smell that amazing aroma of freshly baked donuts. Being that it was late afternoon; I wasn't expecting to have my donuts so fresh. Boy was I wrong. I walked in and was immediately greeted (definitely a plus in my book). Looking at all they offered and being that I had never tried their donuts; I decided to get half a dozen of the funkadelic donuts. I should also mention that there was no one else there; so the employee was very patient as I decided on what to get. ..I chose 2 samoas; a maple bacon; cherry cheesecake; chocolate chip and tree hugger (I think). ..The samoa tasted almost exactly like the cookie; except it was more sweet than I would have liked. The maple bacon was definitely different; but a good kind of different. I will say that the maple frosting really tied the whole thing together. But I may be kind of biased since I truly love bacon more than any person should. The cherry cheesecake tasted almost exactly like a cherry cheesecake; but again too sweet to finish in one sitting. The chocolate chip was better than I could have ever imagined. Sweet chocolate icing; powdered sugar and chocolate chips. How could you go wrong with that combo? The one that really amazed me was the tree hugger. Who would have thought that granola on a doughnut would be good? ..Though I still need to try the other locations; I would recommend this one in a heartbeat.

Km0sT7E_dc2U1BkyRoy1xA,VePZxUbHLKcs1Rs8UF4W_Q,I3zF7f1G6Me2emplms4uNQ,2.0,Food wasn't bad. But the waitress was a disaster. We ordered appetizers and the dinner special which included soup and salad. The appetizer arrived and a minute so did our entree. We asked about our soup and salad and the waitress said she would bring it right out. When we reminded her that the soup and salad should come after the entree she was at a complete loss about what to do. So we told her to forget about the soup and salad and take it off our bill. They reduced the bill for $3.48! The poor kid had no training and failed to follow up or apologize for the screw up. Other than that the good here is decent. Just make sure you get a seasoned wait person!
1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,8Y2ZQqfR2dPzciLWwg6F_g,tgaFkYK5ZD41a2_AlPxE-w,3.0,Came into Yolos for happy Howe st at the bar and the server came right in front of me did a bunch of things on the register and did not even acknowledge us even though I know she saw us. Many minutes later she came and took our order. The food here was amazing. We had the steak nachos and chicken quesadilla. very high quality meats and products used to make the food. If you dint mind the not so great service stop in and try the food...I give the food 5 stars and the service 1 star
tlZmJBQ9UWkaI0Zce_KFhg,M7rBV-dNcugqWM9vd--L2g,FcQgpwV_Aq8eZTPzQfO2xw,4.0,I love this place for breakfast; it's cheap and actually pretty good. I've been going here for many years; I like the fact that after you have been there a few times the waitress remember what your drink order is every time. It's kind of like cheers; it's a place for regulars; a place close to home. It is a cozy and inviting place and that is what makes it worth going in my opinion. The coffee is pretty good too; I like that Irish cream coffee cream is available. It's the little things I appreciate in a place.
w2yx8dfNXi3TcPZSdQOw3A,gWxuXLY25gGGZl85Q2rgRw,pSbg99XmPTygZYiYZyRqZw,4.0,I have eaten at this location several times.  I normally order a specialty salad and a pizza.  My food is always delicious...no complaints from me!
966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,RwuVw04sh8yu08AFQKSDww,mXKp936aqZhUwatEGmwlCA,3.0,went for lunch on Sunday. I ordered the stir fried rice noodles in XO sauce; it was dry and one-dimensional. The Shanghai steamed dumplings were OK; not as tender as I was expecting and didn't wow me. My wife ordered one of the sizzling clay pots; which wasn't sizzling. But it is cool that they have it on the menu; it is not easy to find this dish in the states. Our dishes took about 40 minutes; not what I would call 'quick'. I may have been spoiled by too many years living in China and eating amazing noodle and rice dishes; but there are better places for noodles in Vegas; there are better places for authentic Chinese; and better places for American Chinese.

aWzp373TChor3kYz_BcWZA,UBnmI0Ee3wPF2SmDCVKk8w,nD9yYYzkJzibbGzI6jlM-w,3.0,My boyfriend and I decided to try out Made LV for dinner. We've been here for brunch in the past. ..I tried the grilled cheese and fries. The crust was very crunchy and required a lot of chewing just to get it down. The rest of the bread was toasted just right with a garlic butter. The cheese needed a little more kick and the sandwich overall needed more cheese. It tasted more like cheese toast.  I prefer a more hearty grilled cheese...My boyfriend tried the double stack cheeseburger with fries cooked medium. The bread was soft and the burger flavorful. ..I'll come back to keep trying different items.
RwRNR4z3kY-4OsFqigY5sw,lR9n8KTt8IzmjbH4B7-7rA,z4kqhYy6x5GlEDj1RKwvnw,2.0,Not really cheesecake.  Tastes like egg custard.  Very over hyped.  Would not wait more than 15 minutes.  We got lucky and did not have to wait to long to get one.
YJS7cXGLAvWw9DUDXpw84Q,Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ,AbPGCfzeLQ5MGBERxeKDjw,3.0,I was expecting a fast casual type of place (like an Italian Pei Wei) but actually it is a full service restaurant complete with a separate bar area. They had very swanky; modern decor but still kept it super casual; most of the diners in there on a weeknight were families with kids in shorts and jeans. Everyone from the hostess to the server to the bussers were friendly but brief. Service was pretty much on par with the price point (about the same as Olive Garden)...This place has a very large menu and that is always a turn off for me since I feel that means they don't really have a special focus and so the overall quality of food (ingredients and preparation) will suffer. However; the food was pretty good. Pesto bruschetta was pretty much just cheesy bread so that got me worried that the pasta was also going to be heavy with cheese and cream sauces like so many other chain Italian places So; I opted for the beet and roasted brussel sprout salad. This turned out to be surprisingly good. All the ingredients tasted very fresh (except for the beets; ironically; I believe these were frozen since they lacked flavor) and the dressing was crisp and light. It was a very tasty salad and also very filling since I got the small size for an entree. I did also try my husband's pesto penne and that was pretty good as well. It was a thin sauce; not creamy; which I thought was very good. It did notice; however; that there were strands of spaghetti mixed in with the penne which reinforced my factory assembly line visions of food preparation in places with overly lengthy menus...Babbo won't replace our favorite Italian places and would not be on my list of destinations for a planned dinner out. But due to the low prices and speedy service it is a good option for a weeknight supper when I just don't want to cook. I noticed they do curbside pickup so that is a big plus; too.

w5axMYWy5bcY0tiqAnYeRg,emClTWXE_ou1_RJ5PHIAUQ,N61GWpRBxKtDTR2Gjb7sGg,5.0,I love this place. There are three set menus that you can pick ($100/person; around $130/person; around $150/person). After ordering drinks and stuff; the bill can be almost $200 per person but I think it's worth it. You will be stuffed and satisfied when you walk out the door.
Xs2iTWxbczvfEapAFH3cyw,N8M8KBiVwRRwY8DsjPVIvg,C2-QFZep7pwBoSw4s4rMUA,1.0,After all the hoopla and all the recommendations finally decided to give this place a shot. I'm with my best friend and my 3 year old son.  We walk in and get seated right away. place looks really nice and plenty of people vouch for it. We sat down and not a single word has been said by our server. we start looking at the menu and talking it over with my friend and son. A family sits next to us and still waiting for a 4th person. the server walks up to them and gives them the run down walks to get them coffee and waters. walks back and helps the 4th person get into their seat. he explains the menu and says he will be back shortly. He walks to the other table on our other side; helps them and asks of they need anything else. We are ready to order and he keeps walking and helping everyone else around us. The man next to us leans over and says  want me to order for you guys? i can clearly see whats going on I say no thank you. I wait another 10 minutes and still nothing. my son is asking for pancakes and juice. The man and family next to us receives their meals and are looking at us ashamed considering they arrived around 10 minutes after us and to this point the server has yet to say 1 single word to us. I finally have had enough and wave down the server he shockingly walks over and i ask for the manager he doesn't say a word and walks away. Him and another man walk towards me the server sarcastically says did i forget to serve you i told the manager the story and that i was leaving. he said OK have a nice day  everyone looked as us as we got up put our coats on and heard my son saying he wanted pancakes. As a purple heart recipient from the war in Iraq this is not what i think about when i think of America. I don't think i have ever felt this from a business. the embarrassment and walking away like we did something wrong by walking out. No single apology or NOTHING. So i cant recommend a business in which didn't even serve us a glass of water. I can assure that neither I or anyone I know will ever attend this establishment after this incident. NO APOLOGY WAS EVER RECEIVED.

V9O0_L64Hj9GH0fic3zlug,gI8J0bK37cXpdrOb8wK_Ew,XCpS9-tfduA4qtAMRsJn9A,3.0,A decent frozen yogurt place.  You get exactly what you expect: a nice variety of flavors and lots of toppings.  I gave it 3 stars because I think yogurtology (just down the street) has better flavors and more options.
8ysapimCImBSDKl28qIrjA,dzvwgJiLk_mLiBNLEJMbag,5pTa2Vc_KJJ4tz2uU6_sxg,2.0,First time visiting this place and I was not impressed. ..It's dirty; a little disorganized (I understand that a restaurant will end up disorganized due to the chaos; but that does not excuse it from being dirty.)..The carne asada burritos were o.k. They don't have guacamole. .Their three way burrito is disgusting. It's meant to have green and red chili with beans; but I bit into the red chili side and didn't get to see if it had any green chili; because I stopped eating it...Price is decent. Paid 16 dollars for 3 burritos; but for the type of food I got; I wouldn't pay 5 dollars for it. The quality is not great. ..I wouldn't recommend it.
vIAEWbTJc657yN8I4z7whQ,_77s6LTBJ4BrDoR1phYiWg,FBpSLo8sTVUm9mQ0E21Jbg,1.0,I've learned my lesson. The only consistency I find at Starbucks is they are very inconsistent. For the great variety they offer; I kept trying the company and going to different locations but they suck. For this specific trip; they couldn't properly pour water in the oatmeal. They filled it with such a small amount; it wouldn't get all the ingredients wet. I walked up to the front for more water but nobody would help me. They didn't want to deal with any issues so I left a note and my oatmeal on the counter...I will now frequent Einstein Bagel more and hopefully they will continue their consistency as they expand there offerings and market share.
bsFZnc2mYyGy5cFf5EWTWg,sK0ZbjWSihdy-FlNCOlRLw,yI2Cse3VERCxeDIzckrRag,4.0,Place was pretty packed. Sushi here is always great. The fire house roll is unique and you love it or you hate it. Services was really slow when we went; but recommended.
RWGI8u00x5GghYCEzpYrIg,AIJMhq-NUF9VZEnGbdWhHA,jOvwfx_Ppm1YO3WJSgbPMg,5.0,Atwater Market is a foodie's delight! There's everything from macaroons to fresh bread to pate. We popped in here with the babies ( I recommend a baby carrier; there's room for a stroller but there's too many steps) to pick up some items for dinner. Each of us picked a course and purchased items from Atwater market. I was incharge of appetizers and I picked up bread; pates (so many kinds!!); chorizo and fresh mozzarella. Mains was a lobster salad and dessert was macaroons. ..We also had lunch at Atwater market.. I loved my smoked meat sandwich with spicy mustard from Roule ma Poulet. They had a paella that my friend got; it was good but sooooo huge! ..A great way to spend an afternoon if you have the time.
hF1-dtY_oXfngC8h2mY4qg,bnfiNF0jpL1glJGd1W0wvg,up4mpYnJhJjBsV58jAwhKA,5.0,This is my second five-star review for Vue 412.  We dined here on December 10th for our family Christmas dinner with our children.  I can't even begin to tell you how pleased we all were with the food; and especially the service.  Our waiter; Nathan was outstanding.  He was very friendly; and the service he provided was above and beyond.  He was always checking in to make sure we had enough to drink; to make sure our appetizers were fine; and that we were all happy with our dinner selections.  The food was incredible.  My sons both had the Osso Bucco; and they raved about it; and the portion was quite substantial.  There was also the Tortellacci; Scallops; Veal Parmigiana; and I dined on a special of steak topped with crab.  Everyone raved about their dishes; and the portions were all plenty.  Thank you again to our server Nathan for the excellent service; and for making our family Christmas dinner even more special.  We will definitely ask to be seated at your table the next time we dine.

qRymrsLmlA34bC8PvNoujg,Zb2T6JhcBGzgc6RWmldbDg,xqcsdtYFoBrXqB1wM637jQ,5.0,Was excited when I had business on the NW side of town; because I knew I was going to be back here; and glad I did.. It did not disappoint!.3 great words! .Pumpkin Mushroom Soup! Craving it now... Silky souffle type soup with pieces of mushrooms. Not heavy; just right! .Stuffed grape leaves - delicious! .I also tried the greek meatballs which were tender and a tangy sauce to dip them in; however good on their own. .Will be back when on that side of town! Hands down the best greek food in town..
JZGmFF4K2S1XaxIR6snqwQ,Od9RoT3qdf0ZPkJZOAiJ4A,YGXo4O7Vemai1nLuqmWYsw,3.0,Fun place for lunch.  A bit pricey.  Hubby had Carbonara pasta and I had BLT chicken task sandwich.  Sides of lobster bisque (tasty!).  Berry lemonade.  Very filling.  Fast; clean;
bLi48v8Div6Qm2Fyaw0C6Q,jJZanvr5-dO1nWyFDJz1Kg,ZGa3mdl07aQ-WlOMpWvqmQ,3.0,Hodges; one of our favorite restaurants hands down.  We went with another couple who says the same thing; last night!  But woah on the sodium!  Everything we ate (entire party agreed) was overly salted.  We had the animal style tater tots; market salad (also salty); and I personally had the pumpkin soup; also very salty.  Friends had the meatloaf and a burger.  The food was barely tolerable; to be honest.  Salt sits on the table for a reason so please; less salt!  We love you; Hodges.
thYC66m1cYM-uQSkMQePZQ,-kQkrKDXs12XiXVz18Bvxg,9up-MnIoncim4iwhMtxVGg,1.0,This was something great. Then you broke it...This Dickie's location menu has changed dramatically. The only listed sides are waffle fries and okra. I do love their okra; but have no idea what foo foo seasoning is supposed to be. That's it. No beans; no slaw; no mac & cheese. Then; the coup de grâce: the plates and sandwiches have all changed. My big pulled pork sandwich is no more. There is one similar; but it has a bunch of junk in it. Everything is now ala carte - no plates; no specials board... I don't know what Dickie's had in mind making this change; but I no longer will patronize this location. In my opinion; this is a mistake for the business. My coworkers are also disappointed; as we visited at least once a week. Guess we're going somewhere else. ..You've lost us Dickie's.
tQifTiY-vutj8orxcMJKfQ,TDhchiZiQuFu_mU34pA0ww,HEhKM_H4j4HLYj54HazkwQ,5.0,Triple George is by far one of my favorite restaurants downtown. The service is impeccable; particularly Marti and Todd. My go to meal here is the chicken pot pie (huge and sharable) and the chopped salad. You really can't go wron"
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,-bPHWQp8KDmC5tLc_3_XRw,Ks3ytcu4XA5vWSw_T0iKMQ,4,One of several Cocoa 70 localities in the city including the production facility. The chocolate is processed wonderfully you can even purchase their bars in a variety of percentages of cocoa at each location .The location on Av du Parc has a pleasant and attentive staff who speak French and English. The location was not busy for a Saturday afternoon which was a concern at first. We were brought a bottle of water to start for the table. The menu is simple with a wide variety of savory and desert crepes to chose from. We had the Strawberry and Cheese cake as well as the Crepe with banana and chocolate sauce with whipped cream. The cheesecake filling was delicate and creamy. As well as an Americano coffee. The location takes credit or cash. There is good paid parking on the street.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,suHBY06yKU8GZICWuU1k2w,b_CDr9NGm0O_ocJhJj3ibQ,5,Went there for breakfast with my son. We had the crepe Nutella and the crepe fruit and Nutella and their cheesecake. I ordered my coffee and my son orange juice. Service is friendly and fast. The food is very nice and excellent taste. The place is so cheerful and looks sunny with the open windows. Very nice breakfast/brunch for Sunday morning.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,As67Tnu0LMOEKCEyAX2e7A,4,I had a bad experience in the flagship location but decided to give them a second try at their location on Parc avenue and oh my; what a difference!!..I think I just had the best-cook waffle ever! Crispy on the outside; chewy on the inside! Love it!..The ambiance was great; on a Sunday night; not too crowded; a great place to spend the last moment of a weekend with the love one!..Next time I'll go back there to try their salty menu!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,gB4hYnUWPxHdZmDEhuzLgg,4,This restaurant is very different from the one on St-Catherine in several ways and personally I prefer the latter..Loft style and spacious; but the noise and smell of the machinery were quite disturbing. The food is a bit disappointing but it's still fine chocolate dessert.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,-kkHPNvc4dxBHmYgHCNVfQ,uJ2kQxZOcjAqd1NS7doBRA,3,Overpriced for what it is. I would describe it as fine; but I don't think I will be returning to this restaurant after having given it two chances and feeling it was mediocre both times.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,SXrDzW8PERUTUaJz_UzY-A,9GBt5waXEpFcspppOEgVxA,3,Despite I'm a huge chocolate fa; theDark chocolate shake was still way too sweet for me and my friends; she has to pour a cup of water in it to make it drinkable; I would only recommend it whoever enjoys sweet flavour a lot. The chocolate marshmallow pizza was good; although; sweet as well; but the marshmallow was grilled very nicely; it's crispy outside and melted inside; combined with the crust; the only downside was the fruit that comes with it; strawberry and bananas; are a little dry. I ordered a hot chocolate as well but I guess the server forgot about it; which in this case is forgivable cause the quarter of the pizza for two of us is already more than enough sweet for one day; and no way I could finish the hot chocolate after the slice; will come back if I ever walk pass.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,DRr0CKXKai4yKnyvV7OgCQ,clUSX_SbT0fOI7hJh4naUA,4,Got the single dark chocolate fondue (with fruit; brownie; waffle). It didn't seem worth $9.50... Until I realized there was a full CUP of rich chocolate. By the end I couldn't finish it and reluctantly had to share. A bit of a girly vibe; but the servers were helpful and friendly to our group ofbdudes. Would definitely come again!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,orm1w73VdrYAEvYc-xCnrg,ob-Z05PAmdNgcCLjkmuYrg,5,I was the first customer in the restaurant; so it was quite peaceful. I ordered the banana split waffles; they were unreal! I fell into a caramelized dream full of bananas; vanilla ice cream; sugar crispies; milk chocolate ganache; and choco-pops. I felt like an umpa lumpa; minus the green hair and orange face; add a full round stomach. It's better than Gene Wilder's vision of Charle & the Chocolate Factory! I'll post a picture too; you should check it out! #WillyWanka #GoldenTicket
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,88PdihQ-Rx8QEDwQFyR0uw,npOrimK-mTcOVpGdazQJvw,4,Quatre étoiles pour les portions gargantuesques (petits appétits; adeptes des diètes; en attente d'un diagnostique de diabète; optez pour le partage). Mention spéciale à la gaufre banana split. Belle et succulente création. Le service est très courtois et l'ambiance est agréable.  Laisser tomber la belle de Roméo à quelques rues de là. Cacao 70 lui a damé le pion et il n'utilise pas de Nutella; LUI!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,mIOZQ379FL_qhcigo7776Q,oaH3KBMQs4DsFcvt3vPh1w,4,i ordered the chocolate oatmeal; honestly i did not like it and I should have listened to te waitress; but their hot chocolates were bomb; and my friends ordered the STRAWBERRY SHORT CAKE crepe which was delicious; I will go back again to order other items. price is moderate; and atmosphere was great but service was a little slow.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,JE6ZqyqHRwTfhuDdhhS3bA,OTv1B7vrSSX401QiqvIcOA,4,Went here for brunch this morning; and I'm definitely a fan! My friend wanted to take me to Le P'tit Plateau for brunch; but the line extended way out the front door. Since we were in a time crunch; we decided to eat across the street at Cacao 70...We were seated right away when we arrived at 11:30am (it seems people tend to go out for brunch a lot later in Montreal); and attempted to decide if we wanted sweet or savoury. Lucky for us; Cacao 70 gives you a free appie fruit plate with dark chocolate dip to start. We LOVED this (ordering this separate is $5); but wish it had come at the end of brunch instead of at the beginning. I ordered an Americano; which was surprisingly delicious; considering this place isn't known for their coffee...I originally wanted to order the blue mushroom omelette; but I couldn't change the order to not include swiss cheese (the omelette mix is pre-made); so I decided to order the veggie frittata instead. The veggie frittata came as a huge portion in an iron pan for $12.50 and included eggs; spinach; tomato; basil and feta cheese; baked in an oven. It also came with a side of whole wheat sourdough bread. I was barely able to finish half of this; and took the rest home as a second meal...My friend ordered the open faced chicken sandwich ($11.50) and also only had good things to say about it. ..My bill with tax and tip came to about $18; which was very reasonable for coffee; 2 meals and the adorable fruit plate at the beginning. I definitely want to come back; but for the sweet menu next time!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,933NaWG9W6Z-1pXMFPKOoQ,ZsnwKH-zQz8I1Wa7hpI6MQ,4,I've gone to both locations in Ottawa; and since Juliette and Chocolat was full when I called; we decided to go here with a group of friends. ..Felt cozier than the Ottawa locations; and more spacy. Service was pretty quick; and food was delicious as usual.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,_NG9dVb8YTNc4xjy8R6odw,n15roYiXXMcRKn5GTP8scw,4,Great dessert. Don't expect fast service but nice and worth the wait. Late night spot to check out and they have places all over the city
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,3wt2z4p4k4ZkG0V2SKAd3w,aMev2XvqFEVLtOfQbOvO2A,3,I would say this place is good; however; it's nothing special. Everything was good; and the customer service was amaZing along with the theme of the restaurant. It was big; and very filling which I could not finish. It says it's a breakfast spot; but more like a desert spot ( crepes; ice cream; coffee ). The waiter was nice enough to let my mother keep her Tim's iced Capp. Overall; cool to try out!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,Z6UZvxZDgDsFn-f54QDzpQ,F0zgazY0tiML7ultc5HZGQ,5,The menu here was so hard to pick from! I got the black and white waffles since the bf is a waffle person so we could share. The chocolate quality was great - SO yummy. The crunchy ball toppings were also tasty. The waffle itself was very good - the perfect amount of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Put it all together with the cold ice cream and we got ourselves a perfect dessert!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,3H5Ty7TV7SZvZLa1oTUGDg,M2Q6g2mr5qg70H09IriZCA,4,Je n'y ai que dégusté un dessert; mais c'était vraiiiiment délicieux! Nous avons pris le frappé au gâteau au fromage et aux épices d'automne; MIAM! On l'a tout fini malgré l'immensité du dessert! C'était excellent; les goûts étaients parfaits et le prix très très raisonnable! ..Je recommande pour les dents sucrées!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,XUMv6SY9KQZ9MJ0gmMJs0A,SBQy6DWUabUXl3_IzhRyEQ,3,Ambience is okay but I thought $7 was a bit steep for a milk shake or frappe.  It was just a regular sized glass of frothy milk shake.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,QODR0Tiuzj0nLyTcWGqYAA,eTIi-m6MC9i1_HLPsZwzdA,1,Just waited almost 20 minutes for cake take out; the restaurant was almost empty. The when I asked what was taking so long the waitress apologized and said she couldn't say anything to the kitchen because they won't listen to me. Don't care how good it is; not worth $10. The Triple Chocolate Cake doesn't have much chocolate...
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,fHrCK0tAEzUPXBVGObGzAQ,lisJ3DbtnY3Flsek0_6fcg,3,Cacao 70 is a standard version of chocolatier / dessert places these days. With many other options for patisserie; ice cream and crepes; Cacao 70 wouldn't be my first pick unless you were craving chocolate fondue. I ordered the volcano which was a brownie with vanilla ice cream; strawberries; caramel / strawberry and chocolate sauce. The brownie was alright but I have a particular aversion to 'generic-tasting' vanilla ice cream so I was disappointed to see that a joint specializing in dessert wouldn't invest more into a high quality vanilla ice cream. Other than that the sauce were pretty average; nothing to rave about. On top of the taste; the value for money isn't great considering a single brownie dessert is $8-14. Still; Cacao 70 deserves three stars for its convenient location; attentive staff; clean environment and average desserts.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,oaWmCfL9Z4gYgQVowoxtIw,hIcslWmqp9WD-R7HG7DWoA,1,Once we got to the restaurant they took more than 20 minutes to even come get our drink order. We order our food as well; and another 30 minutes later the food arrived. I order the triple chocolate pizza. That should have been called the almost-no-chocolate pizza. ..The pizza came out as just a piece of hard dough with a few sprinkles of milk chocolate on the top. There was little that could mask the taste of the dry bread you were eating. The pizza also came with a cup of white chocolate; which I decided to pour onto the piece of bread they called pizza; which only made it taste worse. All my friends also tried my pizza and they agreed it was some of the worst pizza they had ever had. ..I heard that their shakes and sundaes were fine. So if you go here; please avoid the pizza.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,1GCkcAM4P0pLa4ntB9KAmw,nY94FHNdgrHfnQxJm8KkXA,5,The waitress was an absolute fembot missile launcher.. the food ran over me like a soviet steam roller.. the espresso with ice cream made me want to go and salt a pretzel and dip some mustard in it. Place was revolutionary if you're not going here you are a bender and should probably go and kick rocks.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,UCqsm9FfQ-xOw1GIrFHj-Q,3p431I03Y_zktKCItLGVeA,2,My friend and I came to Cacao 70 for special brunch and we were greeted by a waitress there. The food was good but the service was not. We are both poor university students and we understand that the social norm for tipping is 15%; but when you barely have enough money to feed yourself; tipping isn't something that you'd have the luxury to do. We both tipped 10%. It's not as if we didn't tip. The waitress pointed out that we didn't tip the usual 15-20% and asked us if the service was poor. Of course we understand why she would ask; but her attitude made us very uncomfortable. We said that we weren't dissatisfied by the service; and then she proceeded to ask us why we didn't tip the regular 15-20%. Her manners were rude and hostile. Although the food was good; the service and this waitress's attitude ruined our whole meal. I'm not sure if I would return to this restaurant.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,km3lnJeuDtQrtKxyU1Dwfg,d4o4mcK9vddAz_smGLEv1Q,4,I came here for brunch with some friends; and it was a great experience! The menu is full of chocolatey-goodness; and their brunch menu is quite extensive as well...As I had already eaten something before I met up with my friends (OOPS); I ordered a strawberry white chocolate milkshake. It was served cold; and it was VERY creamy in a good way. The strawberry flavour really came out and I was a little sad when it was finished. ..After my milkshake; I couldn't help myself and I ordered a parfait as well. DELICIOUS. ..The service was great and I look forward to coming here again!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,Dn8PSKgNszrWjyfu6l9NOw,6O7TkZR3BxweFMyX5ktUAA,3,Great hot chocolate and dessert. The hot chocolate ($10) comes as chocolate melted into a cognac glass with a side of standard hot chocolate to mix in creating a delicious; thick; and rich drink. My gripe with Cacao 70 is the decor and atmosphere. Coming here feels like going to a cheap cafe; there's no warmth or character. This is not something I normally put any weight on; but a fancy hot chocolate joint should put some effort into being cozy.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,fuQQ_OwRt50LDrLl1530Ew,qJAfgH55mWLuV7gHp3ndag,1,Cacao70 était notre seconde option pour ce brunch du dimanche...Nous avons attendu; et attendu; et attendu...une heure pour obtenir des oeufs dans une poêle qui se battaient en duel; du bacon; un peu; des beans secs...le café servi trop tôt avait eu le temps de refroidir et quant aux fruits qui ont suivi avec la fondue de chocolat; ce n'était pas l'extase...Une chose est sûre; je n'irai plus !
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,Vy_RM0FrXy4o9VZY04ozHA,qoUuQK1YOszPbHO2BhP4PA,4,Cacao 70 is definitely a place you should check out if you're a dessert lover. A friend of mine had been dying to get her hands on some good dessert so we figured this was the place to go. ..The menu is massive; yet there aren't many options for those with restrictions; allergies; etc. My only option was basically fruit and dark chocolate; which I did enjoy; but it's hard to get that wrong. Although I will admit that the portion of fruit was tiny. With that said; my friend seemed to enjoy what she ordered. Another thing I noticed was that it was extremely hot in the restaurant to the point where it made you feel uncomfortable - not fun. The service was relatively quick; and our waiter was very nice. It took them awhile to clear the tables when customers had finished; but the rest of the restaurant seemed clean. ..This is a great place to go if you have a sweet tooth!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,kuCA070dzzoF1y1sKuH8JQ,8Jr6oGwE_nVzzgyVgWtrZQ,1,Went by at 10:20 PM (40 minutes before closing time) to grab a quick bite. The two employees were there; doing nothing. There were no other clients. I was told they couldn't serve me for kitchen reasons. I sais I could eat in under 10 minutes (what I wanted was pre-cooked and ready to serve!) and they insisted that they didn't have time before their closing time and was told more insistently to leave. Very poor work ethoc; was very disappointed l.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,wLfxuS5BxXfsqLXOEDYRrw,4,Been to this place several times. The service is good and the place is quite clean. If you love chocolate and sweets but also want to eat something salty because you're a reasonnable person who doesn't just eat sweets for a main meal; this place is great. They have both. From brunch and salads to milkshake and crepes; their menu has many varieties.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,BCjsgRFDCxGQHr0hVlwqvg,HHobMusAY1WpqVLi8-BXqA,5,We've already been to Cacao 70 in Toronto so in Montreal it was a must visit for us. I chose this place for our anniversary celebration and I asked one of the staff to make it special by writing anniversary wish on our waffle plate but she said that she'll ask the chef if they can do it...few minutes later she came back and said that they can't but they can arrange a candle. So yes the day was special and of course we love chocolate so it was a bonus and I again fell in love with Cacao 70. Fondue is a must have and yes Hot chocolate on a cold day!!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,xva4w2TD1YjAzjxw4qjdRQ,OR9qMGXR91L3Kc6KALLwNw,4,This chocolate experience was divine. I went with the Belgian beans and ALMOST finished all of my cacao. That is actually a pretty impressive accomplishment IMHO because the servings are quite generous. If you know someone who loves hot chocolate and or chocolate in general; do them a favour and introduce them to this place.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,vAB2A3Fq7lUg4XcK0E3Akw,EOCQTXvppHuXX48h_Q3-mQ,1,I always come here to eat; but tonight was particularly stressful. We came here at 22:15 because we are both working late night shifts and are used to a late schedule. We usually never had problem coming here an hour or less before closing time... Tonight though; the second we got our seat; we were just told to leave before 45 minutes. Working in restauration service as well; never have I ever told this or was allowed to say this to a customer. It instantly makes you feel unwelcomed and it causes anxiety and pressure my whole meal. I came here to enjoy a good dessert and I'm used to a good service and that's why I choose this place. But tonight i felt pressured to finish my meal and leave; couldn't even enjoy my late night dessert. Anyway; the food was good as always but service was very unfriendly!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,tmqAnKBcKcVrAi2RxAD91A,WtUiqM1ZCWY5eRRH8fKx7w,4,I came here for a little afternoon snack last weekend. ..I ordered something called the volcano which was a brownie with ice cream; strawberries; coconut and caramel. My friend ordered a raspberry smoothie and a banana/strawberry/chocolate crepe. The portions were extremely generous and generally the food was delicious. I found my selection to be overly sweet and it caused a sugar induced headache; but I think that was my fault for indulging in such a rich treat. My boyfriend enjoyed his selection as well. We also ordered tea...My only complaint was that service was really slow at the beginning- we kept getting ignored for a good 20 minutes before they took our order. Also; it was quite loud inside; especially with some crying kids.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,pQ02Y1VCqcV7vZV_id2VsA,QG2fExX-PA4NQF_9EQricw,4,the chocolate is bomb af but the waiters are too slow even on an empty night :( ..highly recommend the crepes but dont get the chocolate pizza it tastes weird 1/10 would recommend
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,T2SXgdV9uXwAwduBTOjdRg,4,So chocolaty and so good. Their menu is pretty big. It's a great place to catch up with friends.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,_Yz9MFmsYnJxFSa10XSgfA,9kkFWFfpup2kWXA1HeGiaQ,4,Got here right when it opened; only a couple other people. I walked in and was promptly greeted and sat down. I was in the mood for brunch food so of course I got a crazy decorated waffle (After Party Waffle) and a side of bacon to make things a bit savory. I also decided to order a black sesame hot chocolate. You can order the mix of this to make at home; by the way...The food came out quickly and everything was really presentable (seeing as how Instagrammable all this food is) and pretty much lived up to aesthetic expectations. In terms of taste; the waffle was now a bit soggy from the mound of whipped cream on top. The extra toppings on the side were nice but I didn't even finish it all because it got too sweet after a while. The bacon was a little smaller and thinner than I would've expected for the price...I think if you're expecting a meal; this could be a place but this restaurant is really good for dessert. The waffles are meant to be for dessert; not necessarily for a meal. The sides might break your wallet and not be as filling. ..Overall; I'd come back whenever I'm in a city in Canada that has one!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,TaLqo3CdIxqkuec8xz3PgQ,4,Excellent place for snack or dessert... Great variety. Chocolate quality is good. Waffles are great. A delicious treat... And very well presented. ..Prices are reasonable considering the amount of chocolate they give you. ..A few things to improve: the wafers in our plate were really stale. The brownie is too dense and too sweet to be enjoyable..Waitresses were very nice.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,tClwFXDK-T9Ue_2IwpbnBg,v1U-B6WJ1VY3C3dA2bA4hg,5,My wife and I thought this was just a place for chocolate. Boy were we wrong.  We looked in and saw a customer with frittata in a cast iron pan and realized the menu must be more expansive.  It was.  We both had frittatas and they were excellent.  You are served with a small platter of pineapple; strawberries and banana with a small dish of melted chocolate before your entree is served. A mini fondue if you will. Delicious.  We will definitely be going back to try their crepes; waffles and sandwiches.
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,XdXqwbG_S03aEXj38sFffg,f677aR4KqAbkt1YB2CEhEg,4,A good place for brunch and I'd recommend going when you're pretty hungry. I got the vegetable frittata  (with toast) and it came with a mini fondu with strawberries; bananas and pineapples. I wasn't able to finish and probably should have split one meal with a friend. Overall; it's a decent place; lots of seating and dessert/brunch choices for different taste buds!
dXwDDsQv3tMzw69pqmD-Vw,D4m-n64sg2swgIf0Zg6WHg,WOFJioCtwC4EX169iR9Asg,4,Came here for my friend's birthday along with my other friends. We took the sharing sharing menu for 2 or more; which essentially has most of delicicacies of the menu covered. It contained a quarter of triple chocolate pizza; marshmallows for roasting; grahm crackers for smores; fresh strawberries for fondue; chocolate covered waffles; and carmelized bananas. I found the waffles to be the best of them all. The waffles were hot and perfectly crunchy. The service was fast and the waiter was very nice and cheerful. I love the clean; pristine atmosphere of the place. I would most definitely come back to satisfy my sweettooth! :)

e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,CqaIzLiWaa-lMFYBAsYQxw,6WjAnuyegUCF10pCy8LWRg,4,Excellente place sur Laurier Ouest; au cœur du Mile End. Une grande terrasse abritée pour les grosses chaleurs; un service rapide; des assiettes (très) copieuses et un café délicieux..A la carte des brunchs classiques : bénédictines; gaufres; crêpes; œufs... servis avec une plus que généreuse portion de fruits frais et patates rôties..Un peu loin de chez nous mais j'y reviendrais avec plaisir; cette partie de Laurier est une mine d'or pour le magasinage et la nourriture.
e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,raqTx1Tj-wTMs25mcDPMxQ,HD6M45BQ5jIXum1OXun7QQ,4,Toi & moi cafe never disappoints. Much better than the chain breakfast places. Coffee is excellent. Again much more flavourful than the starbucks; second cup; etc... Prices are very reasonable and good selection of both sweet and salty breakfast dishes. Enjoy! PS: we should have a T&M in the west island.
e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,BFQQ5JYCfhoc4ZVzoCL1jw,idRX87G5mEkrQxMzeymtRg,4,We came here because we had planned to go to Mamie Clafoutis after dinner; however the service at the restaurant was so bad it was closed by the time we left (see review of El Gordo). Irked but still hungry for dessert; we stumbled upon this cute little cafe that has the aesthetic of an early 2000s Jennifer Aniston sitcom/romcom. You almost feel like she'd bump into Matthew McCoughney here; marry him; raise to kids; then bring their perfect nuclear familial unit right back to where it all started. ..We had the profiterole cake - was delish. Bunch of profiteroles artfully arranged in a web of chocolate mousse; berries; whipped cream; and chocolate drizzle on top...As we mentioned before; the decor is a little confused - what is it trying to accomplish? Is it a pasta place? (There's a wine rack and daily specials to boot). is it a dessert place? (They've got dozens of cake varieties served by the THICK slice per day). Or is it; as the name would humbly suggest; just... a cafe? That's for you to decide the next time you swing by.
e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,GB-yA9v2_24mNEwenzklKA,VZOXUTw9GPGC2SlAE1YgYQ,1,Very bad service. The place wasn't even full when we came in but the waitress pretended to be busy with other things instead of seating us at an empty table; made us wait at least 10 min. Food wasn't great either especially for the price they charge. We asked several times for water and it never came until another server poured it for us. We asked for the bill after; and again; it never came; until we had to ask another server who told us to just pay at the counter. Needless to say; bad food; bad service equals no tip. It was our first breakfast in Montreal and good thing we tried other places or the city would have left us with a bad impression with this place.
e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,Yef_LD8bTsSIm3zGq166aA,0Isu7AXFjDliU4qciYooMg,2,Coffee here is surprisingly mediocre (except for some of the French press options). A full-service resto; with food that is just... okay. Open late; which is a plus. Popular with a much older and straighter crowd than all the great cafes in the area (of which there are many). A surpassed old-school cafe which has seen its day. You can do better. Dare to dream.
e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,intbf4y9gWbc8NJRymfVYQ,UxyHYI_vkuJyNBDckemBwA,5,I just want to make it clear that I am rating the coffee not the service which is saddly not up to par. However service in Montreal is typically mediocre from my experience and that said; their service is pretty typical. The food is reasonable and good..THE COFFEE IS AWESOME. Best I have had in Canada bar none. I have not tried the tea but will soon. The Latte is stellar; best I have had anywhere. I have tried several of their roasts and have yet to be disappointed. You can not get a better cup in Montreal.
e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,DHHF35Rhof3KiftnL4K7sw,3,"Definitely not what I expected; I always thought this place did coffee with some paninis and side dishes; like Presse Cafe or Cafe Depot...This is more of a standard resto that serves steaks; pastas and fish. .Seeing as how there are many coffee shops nearby; they have to offer a bit more than the others...But theres also people that come for coffee and dessert only and sit there with their laptops for hours. The place is a bit small and packed; there were only 2-3 waiters on a Saturday...The food was above average; the Bison Burger with Brie Cheese ($12) was very filling; I didn't eat for the rest of the day. It came with a bit of potatoes and a limp green salad. My friend had pasta with chicken Kiev (14); which came with some vegetables; the chicken was a bit dry; but the dish overall was  quite good...Now; onto the coffee: The Cappuccino was heavenly; amazing and under $3; this places specializes in coffee...At first glance; the food menu can look expensive; but it's actually not that bad considering what you get; and it's in a pretty upscale part of town; classy stuff.

I went to the store; as I like the cake designs on their website...I didn't ordered right away but got four cupcakes to go: chocolate; vanilla ; lemon and  red velvet .The lady told me those were basically same as the(some of the) cake flavors. I am sad to say they were: dry; very dry; so dry and super dry :(  And I went in the morning! After that I decided not to order from them...Maybe it was a fluke but that's not good when you're trying to sell cakes:-s..My rating is based on the cakes/cupcakes.

He is cheap as can be and least generous with the assembly of ingredients.  Furthermore; the ingredients are far from fresh.  The bread tastes stale too. Some things never change even though the renovation took place.  You'd think things would improve.  Far from!! Do not go here unless you want to get ripped off."

e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,RMopAcH2eoiOuPkStfg_YQ,Qqd-zNmS1NIcJNrXxqh7Tg,4,I have to say; WOWW to the coffee. Good for hangovers; cure for sleeping; it literally wakes you up within seconds. I loved it so much that I even got some for home. As an probably coffee addict; this one is the only coffee that works on me to make me alert and awake...We went there for a really really late brunch; and I had the cosmopolite(2 eggs; choice of bagel/and tons of toasts); ham; bacon; sausage; beans; potatoes; fruits! It seems like its huge; but its not that big portion; but its not small either. The price for what you get is pretty good I'd say. The reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that their service was not good; the waiter was very slow; and everything took time. Nevertheless; I'd still go back here for the coffee and food.
e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,JudEGM3yUpeTB3ex5YEojQ,0p5UykiL9obIVprPKbzDKA,3,The service was really bad. Ordered pie and it took 30 minutes for the waiter to bring it because he kept forgetting; had to remind him twice.

Un bon endroit pour manger un brunch; même en plein milieu de semaine. Par contre; j'aime beaucoup le décor et l'éclairage de cet endroit en particulier. La terrasse qui est couverte de neige en ce moment me fait rêver de l'été. Si vous avez lu mes autres avis; vous savez qu'en ce moment; terrasse rime avec été et j'ai vraiment; vraiment; vraiment hâte que la chaleur revienne!..J'y ai été pour une courte rencontre donc je n'ai pris qu'un café; un latte; et il en valait la peine. Habituellement; je trouve que les cafés dans les chaîne sont so-so; mais Toi; Moi et Café est une des rares exceptions. Il est super bon; corsé sans avoir d'acidité en arrière goût. Et j'adore les tasses; surtout le bol qui a une poignée; un peu comme une tasse ordinaire de proportion géante! Le service est très bien et on remplissait nos verres d'eau assez régulièrement que je me suis arrêtée à moitié chemin en route pour la maison pour me trouver une toilette tellement on m'a tenue bien hydratée!
e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,W7rNiyDjfTPL60vRTlA4nw,U44FBsfM8uVsPq-ZO04fFA,4,I've only been there for tea (so far---but after one look at the dessert case; I definitely plan to return!) but they've got a wonderful selection of unusual coffee and tea concoctions; including banana split mocha; coffees and teas with alcohol in them (grand marinier; frangelico; amaretto; etc.); a choose-your-own-flavor steamed milk or soda; the list went on and on. I didn't give it 5 stars only because the service was a bit negligent; but nothing that would prevent me from returning again soon.
e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,LubR-V3Lj0E5UQzP20U8nw,I-6_It2qKqgbWA-iGUDtmg,4,Stopped into Toi; Moi et Cafe on a Friday night because we were early for our dinner reservations. I had heard they have the best coffee in town. Unfortunately; i am not a coffee drinker and it actually HURT that i couldn't order an Honore de Balzac brew...The lights were just the right soft-yellow. The wait staff was friendly; helpful and bilingual. I HATE when a waitress gets all flabberghasted when i ask what would you recommend with that? Rather; she gave me a breakdown of the benefits of each option. I appreciate when an employee has actually eaten the place's offerings...Toi; Moi et Cafe has real food. We didn't order it. Instead; we got a The Laurier (Black Tea; Grand Marnier and Fragelico with whipped cream on top). The whipped cream was PERFECT. We compared the taste to Christmas gatherings. It was smooth and decadent...We opted for a chocolate-dipped biscotti from their many options. I love the texture of biscotti and this one was just right. Unfortunately; chocolate-dipped means only about two inches of a rather long biscotti. A little more chocolate would have been nice. It was not the best biscotti; but it was a good one...The chairs were comfortable; the tables clean and not woobly...I recommend.

The patio is narrow and intimate; but offers a nice view of the street with awnings to help beat the heat. ..Service is good; food is great; coffee is outstanding.

A small cafe near to our lunch destination of La Chronique I entered TmeC with modest expectations only to be greeted by a wall of coffees and teas plus pastries; sandwiches; and soups made to order.  Decidedly Francophone in dialect I approached the coffee counter with a bit of trepidation only to find ordering simple as they had one of my favorite beans on roast - a rich Ethiopian Harrar full or deep earthy notes and sweet cocoa tones for $2 that would lead to me returning two days later to pick up two pounds for the ride home.

e9Dem4OvxH2blvEbMule3g,schfOYW71VamTTdfzqDlXQ,kQwjXXjmvaKnIjtOHaIPFQ,3,Three reasons why I can't give it more stars:..1) With the Sunday morning rush my food was sloppily place upon my plate and served to me.  It did not look appealing...2) Their inability to control how customers arranged seating during Sunday rush.  By the end of my meals I was bumping elbows with a group who squeezed in.  The server apologized to me afterward. ..3)  With the Sunday rush no one asked me if I needed anything; if my meal tasted alright.  I was served and left with the bill.  That happens to me at McDonalds...Why did I give stars:..1) The environment is awesome and it feels like a real café...2) Friendly staff.  If it was not the Sunday rush I'm sure I would have been taken care of very well. ..3) Despite the presentation of my food it was delicious.

Needless to say; we were very satisfied with our ad-hoc backup choice...Although she is a cheese lover; my girlfriend ordered the standard tandoori chicken; and I selected the cheese-laden curry poutine; unbeknownst to me how much of a delight it ended up being. (My girlfriend ended up eating most of my dish; while I settled with hers; haha.)..Both dishes were excellent and better than some of the more formal restaurants I've tried at Indian Square in my own neck of the woods. ..Frankly; Mr. Guru needs to open a store in the New York City area. Until then; if you happen to be in the Montreal area; you must drop by this hidden gem.

I messaged Dee; general manager; to inquire of an appointment for last Saturday; April 22nd. I arrived at 10am and was immediately greeted by Dee. The staff were very accommodating. I was walked over to a plush chair with a fuzzy; soft pillow. As I relaxed and waited for the basin tub to fill with water I enjoyed a complimentary glass of wine. Trish did a wonderful job on my feet. She; herself was very pleasant. ..After my wonderful pedicure; I was escorted to the nail bar for a gel manicure. I was told that the polish I picked was organic. My nails were neatly manicured by Ashley. She was very pleasant too. I was sent home with a manicure set. I was in and out within an hour. ..Fast forward to Tuesday...my nails began to chip :(. .I opt for gel manicures for the durability. The polish usually remains unbothered for at least a week. The odd thing is that the polish only chipped on my pointer finger and thumb of my right hand. I'm not sure if it was the polish or the amount of time my hand was under the heat lamp. ..I'll be back for the service. I hope to troubleshoot with them about why my nails began to chip within days of having them painted.

I know it's likely a minimum wage job but I came into the job world with high expectations of appearance. Leave your sweats at home; wear a uniform; put on a smile; take your face piercings out; and act like you enjoy getting your pay check. The male cashier talked down about a fellow employee to a customer as well. This place really needs someone to get the basics of customer service and customer experience back in even the slightest form. I will likely not return due to the lack of professionalism and horrid appearance of the employees.

So make it a late lunch or early dinner and wrap your lips around one of the most creative and accessorized burgers in charlotte.  My favorite is the Big 'Ol Texas burger.  It comes with barbecue sauce; cheddar and onion rings  The burgers ar not as greasy / tasty as Five Guys but still pretty delicious and as I said earlier the options on the menu is mind boggling with all the varieties of burgers from portabella mushroom to jamaican jerk! You also can not go wrong with fries here. The seasoned are my favorite; but most people go ga ga over the sweet potato or disco fries which have more gravy on them than the lord should allow.  Great service although if you are getting your burger well done expect to wait a bit.
u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg,djP46l4v0TQTqhLa-ZB1xw,2TenS-gAQOk7MjIgHZV8mg,3.0,Having lived at the Central Postinos last year; which was my home away from home; I ventured East hoping for the same experience. Well; while it was okay; I will not say it met my expectations and I will tell you why. Big plus Live music. Another big plus: Expanded beer selection including domestic beers in bottles. The food just was not up to par with Central. The Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad; our old fave; lacked Gorgonzola and had WAY too much celery. too little chicken and too may herbs. The apples in it were the size of a gold ball (OK; I am exaggerating; but not much). It lacked finesse. I know the weekend chef may have been new; not skilled; whatever but come on; this is a nice place. We had a Panini which also lagged far behind the Central location. Lacked flavor and the pepper spread was not as spicy. The salad we ordered had almost no dressing on it; which I know is an easy fix; but COME ON this is not a young place...upscale crowd and décor. Great wait staff. They were not the problem. The beer was not the problem. But they should take their kitchen staff over to Postino Central for some training."

I wonder if that's changed under new ownership... I should try it again. .The fish & chips is definitely not the best in the city; as is their claim; and for what you get; it's slightly overpriced.  .The last time I went; the TV was blaring at a completely ridiculous volume. .The decor is pretty rough; but the value for money really helps to make up for this. .Too bad the original owner's gone; he was really nice!  He gave us free gulab jamun once!

Not really. Is the samosa fully cooked inside? On a good day; or else it could have been hammered in the deep fryer. Service? They've forgotten my order sometimes. Water? Tastes a bit funny. Decor? Like an oily steam bath on a hot summer day. Cheesy Bollywood videos on the tele? Or else cricket matches...Veg thali. $5. This modest dish alone earns this joint 4 stars. These goddamn veg thalis fly out of the kitchen all day long; so they'll be fresh...You: I'm starving and need calories now; in the form of an honest; ludicrously inexpensive meal.

ecid5p4yhTEJbWEJTuzX3Q,IryDYja2kFkQEYJ0Kw6GWw,rKohEjUvCk2JVtnlZbIxSw,4,I've only had the curry poutine but I still think I am qualified to review the restaurant. As a vegetarian; I'm not too fond of most poutine because the sauce is very salty. The cury poutine; however; replaces the sometimes bland sauce with a delicious and spicy curry. The fries and cheese are both good; but the star is far and away the sauce. If you don't really like curry or if you don't really like poutine or if you love both; you'll enjoy the curry poutine. It is served in its own green frying pan; which is a nice touch.

ecid5p4yhTEJbWEJTuzX3Q,jehXjSEOVDkmlsXrwpKL9w,g7lm0I4p5XZknWrbHWlIxA,4,I got a veggie thali to go; and I was very happy with it. Good portion for the price; and still hot when I got home. It tasted really good; maybe if I eat in I will ask them for a bit more heat. Friendly guy at the counter who took my order. ..The only thing I have to point out is that the samosa was way undercooked. Like; doughy on the inside. The outside was crispy; filling was flavorful; but the doughiness ruined it. Maybe it was a one time thing (will update accordingly). Otherwise; impressed by this cheap meal option...Edit: Tried the thali again; and this time the samosa was perfect. This will definitely be a too-lazy-to-cook option for me.
ecid5p4yhTEJbWEJTuzX3Q,aYL7qtwOMdzYayaddq_Hnw,respCz3GGZjX-n8GhnvYHQ,3,This place is pretty much the equivalent of a greasy spoon/casse-croute for Indian food.

I'd recommend any of the following:.- Vege Thali.- Non-Vege Thali.- Tandoori Chicken Pita.- and the Curry Poutine..They staff is also really friendly; and quick to remember you if you go back; so that really adds to the whole neighbourhood greasy spoon feel.

Anyway; Le Vieux Dublin is an authentic Irish pub; name notwithstanding; with lots of crowds and foot-stompin' live music. It's actually not that weird a concept; since the Irish are traditionally one of the four founding cultures of Montreal (hence the shamrock on the official Montreal flag)...While it's a great time inside; Le Vieux Dublin is in a rather dead location; and it's tucked away past a parking lot off University; near René-Lévesque. It's a bit easy to miss as a result; but don't give up...
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,Q3g66iHQ0Mg7dRsiP1P8vg,e2tGoVk7MAfPGWFIyvdBSQ,3,I ordered the Duffy burger and it was amazing! I liked their fries too. They have a really interesting menu; a lot of dishes with curry which I'd go back just to try. ..My only gripe would be they don't have a lot of staff (at least when I was there on a Friday after 7PM). The first bar maid was all over the place doing literally everything and she did a great job; I admit. ..Once she left the guy was alright but he seemed clunky and a bit of a dope head. My friend ordered a few Irish coffees which each time came with a different consistency. We ordered shots of Jameson and he basically hinted that we should order 6 (the 6th being for him). ..Other than that I think I'd go back.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,6MM9Yqn7UBM8tmpSHQHAAg,6MF_-6dCbKY2X8-1mSB7IA,2,Un pub n'a jamais besoin d'être compliqué ou fancy. C'est le cas ici au Vieux Dublin. J'y suis allé pour prendre une bière après une soirée au cinéma et c'était bien tranquille; sans prétention; et sans fla fla. Le service a été un peu lent; mais dans un pub avec un seul serveur/bartender; je comprends pourquoi ça arrive; surtout un mardi soir. L'endroit aurait peut-être besoin d'être rafraîchit côté déco; mais en même temps; je pense que ceux qui adore cet endroit; l'aime pour sa simplicité. Ici; c'est une bonne bière et de la bonne compagnie qui sont les éléments importants. Pour la bière; j'ai été satisfaite et pour la compagnie; j'ai bien aimé les grosses banquettes qui permettent d'être une bonne gang assise ensemble en cercle ce qui rend la conversation beaucoup plus plaisante quand on est plusieurs. Par contre; j'ai l'impression que si j'y allais seule ou avec une copine; ça n'est pas la meilleure ambiance. C'est plutôt un bar de gars; à l'irlandaise; donc pas mon genre; mais pas mauvais non plus. Simplement pas à mon goût.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,cB4YGv6Yg3IYXAIjwpdl1Q,50sy8KEIOj75TSLYMYnAEw,3,Pub irlandais; qui n'a selon qu'irlandais que le nom; Le Vieux Dublin est essentiellement un place à hamburger. Quoique correct; on y ferait pas de détour pour les manger. Ambiance bruillante et vieillotte; l'endroit gagnerait à être rafraichit. Le service était cependant rapide et efficace.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,1ViT_LzrNbbrheWgIvT5Tw,l1o7waCh8_MC66PZROHTTQ,3,Pubs have Atmosphere; Service and Food too!..Atmosphere: The Old Dublin is a pub's pub.  Everything wood; everything with purpose - you walk in you know you're in a pub.  Comfortable and in the middle of the downtown core; a great place to meet with friends to watch the game (any game).  ..I will go out on a limb here and say that the days of the Old Dublin may be numbered (along with other places in that area) as a huge and very posh condo complex is being built right next door.  This may hark the advent of more upper-end type dinning locations to accommodate the new residence.  ..Service:  The Staff works hard; so much so they are certainly pushed to the limit on busy nights - but they still maintain composure.  The staff tend to be a little older (i.e. not of the University crowd) and some have been at the Old Dublin for quit some time; and thus give the place a good sense of continuity.  No complaints whatsoever...Food:  Pub food served in a pub way - plain and simple.  Hit and miss sometimes - but it doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't.  Surprisingly - because the cook is Indian - the old dublin has some items on the menu that may surprise you!..Fun place.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,MIKByQgLWgXNU_26CX1Acw,4AjkVxKl1V-Acin2xHingA,4,I had a fantastic time here on my last visit. It was a great place with a lot of wonderful people lolling around; half in the bag. I started up a long conversation with a dude from Seattle about which is worse: a year in New York or a year in LA. We both agreed New York; largely because the Vegas valve is much closer in the LA scenario. ..The selection of beers and ciders is pretty good and though I typically stick to Cider; I did enjoy a couple of lager and had a ball. ..The place gets crowded and gets really loud; but it's a fun time still!
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,VynB_BBYS_F6OaOVVKGt1g,-vX53Uu6kECmQqXcvaUd6Q,2,Food is good but otherwise kind of lame. Usually not a big crowd at night time. Sometimes they have decent music playing
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,eqJX_l9ZES0dahg8h94NTQ,li29k4SY0kAJQQgK3KD6Gg,4,An Irish pub on Yelp with good reviews?  I'm there. ..We stopped in as the snow piled up outside and went straight for the Guinness. After a couple beers we ordered fish and chips. The batter is spot on. It's not too thick; it's crispy; and it had tiny bit of sweetness to it. The fish inside was cooked perfectly. While the chips were tasty; they were small. My colleague suggested that steak fries would be better. He's right. ..Guillaume; we had a great time!  Thank you for hanging out with us. J'espère pour vous acheter une autre bière bientôt; mon frère!
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,YfsHWxuiusj1SGJHXzNzXw,YURYDefXLIY4tEo6gshe0Q,1,Poor service (the waitress asked if we were eating dinner; took our drink order; then NEVER came back to take our food order) Overpriced and tasteless food. And on top of that-rude customers.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,ZVFvQ4_qXyQ3DJpBK6uzBQ,1A3dmqNeM0Oh0miA1yZIRw,3,We just arrived in town and stopped here for our first beverage/meal.  The workers seemed to know several of the patrons.  This; in my view; is a hole in the wall type place where I'm from.  We ordered a Maker's and a half and half.  The makers was truly a 1 oz drink; but my beer was perfect.  I ordered a burger which came with fries; and my wife ordered an extra order of fries.  The burger came out well done; which is fine; and the fries were good.  The burger was very bland; no seasoning at all.  ..The beverages were good.  The entertainment came as we were eating (guy with a guitar); and in this venue; that would be perfect.  There were about 20-25 people in here; so as a neighborhood bar; I'll give it high marks.  The food wasn't the best; but it hit the spot after getting off an airplane.  Overall for us it was just OK.  If you live or work in the neighborhood; though; it looked like a great place to hang out.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,aQkCQ1m2Ugo1v2TKdL952A,bADOIBlLDi_2ekum8bGfww,4,Fish and chips= AWESOME.Beer selection= AWESOME.Friendliness of the crowd= NOT SO AWESOME..I popped in to this bar for a quick dinner and one drink solo while shopping in downtown Montreal.  Everywhere I went was jam packed and I didn't have the patience to wait.  I found this bar a few streets over and decided to go in since I didn't see a line out the door as I saw at other bars and restaurants (apparently there was some hockey game on TV). ..When I first got to the bar; people were cordial and somewhat friendly.  As the night progressed; people gave me dirtier looks and looked very disinterested in making conversation with me.  I didn't know what was going on and I was starting to get a bit upset; so I decided to finish off my beer and food and hail a cab back to my hotel...Just as I was about to leave; I asked the bartender in a very nice manner why people were so cold.  She pointed at my shirt and didn't say anything.  Apparently wearing a Pittsburgh Steelers shirt in to a bar while the Montreal Canadiens are getting their asses beat by the Pittsburgh Penguins isn't the way to go about making friends in Montreal.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,JY4OOwszylZWrE65ZC5j6w,SUuu4NZVFbH4JM-BKM1WdA,5,This little hidden treasure seems like it's out of place....an authentic Irish pub in the middle of French Canada??? But it made me feel like home; though I was clear across the country......Pretty much every night that I was over there; this is where my colleagues and I would go. My fellow Seattelite co-worker would always go here in the past for her Scotch. But they had my Hard Cider! I don't remeber what kind it was; but it was different and delicious. ..The atmosphere is phenomenal- it's loud and packed like an Irish pub should be. Long bar. Great staff. Gooooooood food. This is definately a party/group place. The have 2 levels- we sat upstairs one night because we couldn't hold a conversation among the loud crowd downstairs; so even though they had it closed off; they let only us go up there giving them the perk of us tipping them well. But- I'd much rather be downstairs most of the time. ..I would go back to Montreal for this reason alone.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,1pJmyex-C3Rsa-hsXaWOXQ,5f5JKZSUvH98yY_s2QlyOw,4,The way an Irish Pub should be; too bad they had to move out of the old location. It had such character. Food is great. The curry dishes are super.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,eC21kWOR7ajb-jn4dMkgOg,zzJuhycmfworKY3g717kRA,1,Bartender could tell we were tourists and gave us terrible service. He closed out all of his checks before he brought our drinks over 10 minutes later. Avoid this place.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,mYQmaTeWp87sGnE-rHvIOw,TVtszWA2-5VuPaqrd35m7A,4,As for Irish pubs go; this place was fun; friendly; and had a good vibe. We took over the lower part of the bar and had a great time. The food was really good. A nice variety of traditional and nouveau cuisine.  Big thumbs up. My hats off to the staff for making this place a good spot to watch the Canadiens/Alouettes play.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,7rGyRf5gOVpQruYiPO-1Ng,atUxf8FyfZX-CJ3AsUp5ew,3,Went there with my wife on a lark. Pleasantly surprised to find Indian curries on the menu. And even more surprisingly; the curry was actually better than the fare at a lot of so called Indian restaurant else-where in the world. I had the medium spicy lamb curry which had a thick curry with potatoes and reminded me of home. Absolute comfort food. My wife had the spicy chicken curry which was delicious too. The place had a huge selection of scotches and whiskeys; which we enjoyed on the rock. The lone low point was the Irish coffee which we had ordered two off. They both seemed to have different strength with one being much stronger than the other and the key seemed to be the Irish with the coffee almost as an after thought. All in all; a pleasant experience specially if you love scotch and Indian food.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,eSc8pCT0H1ThVV89dfq6Qw,EVxAI81QyPoPlQGlRNF76Q,3,I like the atmosphere.  A pub with several levels that divides up the space to watch sports or get together for drinks without those two things coming into conflict.  The walls are lined with whiskey boxes and the space has a sense of history; like it's much older than it likely is.  The selection on tap is decent; the selection of whiskey is better.  I can't comment on the food except to say the kitchen was closed at 10:30pm.  Given this is in such a vibrant city; this made no sense and wasn't expected.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,Cjfgh0v54urwg628j4XkMw,S_q20mvuF-cNcLWxMnZMhQ,3,If you consider the atmosphere and the interior of other irish pubs around the globe; this one is a weak one. Though you have the large bar and some irish live music; as well as a great choice of beers on the tap; the interior reminds you up to certain grade of any standard northamerican fastfood / deli restaurant. The tables stand rather close to each other to get the maximum seating capability and the floor isn't the typical carpet but a regular floor...I don't know wether if others see it the same way; but on a wednesday night; when I was there; there were just a handful of customers around. This was actually o.k. for us; as we had to talk some things over. We were a little surprised; as a guitar player startd with some live singing; was this was ok too; as the volume was on a reasonable low level.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,XMZKOrLE5b-alqG3We605g,VHjsxogQN8oeMQeHHoJs7w,3,Good place to stop and grab a beer. They have a large selection of beers on tap!  The service was good. They offered up the happy hour menu even though it wasn't happy hour. We also ordered the nachos with chilli and guacamole. The chilli and guacamole were really good!
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,lOu5t9HG51UDqm4ahVatqA,JAgLgbJATmzYF_2X0swjpA,3,Me and my wife went for a few pints after a long day of flying and thought this place was decent.  The beer selection is pretty impressive; with about 16 beers on draft including 8-10 Canadian beers; some of which I had never heard of.  The staff was somewhat friendly; and same with the crowd.  I thought the prices were high; especially for the non-Canadian beers ($8).  There is also a lot of construction on the block; which made it kind of hard to find.  There are many worse places to go for a drink I'm sure; but I'm pretty sure that there are better ones as well.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,ePGbU51-ODVq8sZfzuH-7Q,gbmCZH2Xo5qRaz4RdyQX6A,4,We enjoyed the Dublin pub with it's selection of beer and atmosphere. Flet sorry for Alison as she was the only server / bar tender in the place with about 40 people. Had to open the downstairs area as so many people arrived. She did a great job in covering it all. Only problem is that we split a dinner and they charged $2.75 to split a meal. Do not think this is fair at all. Great service and busy for 6PM on a Sat night.

The waiter ran away with my plate on asking for my feedback which I gave as I've done here. Avoid anything fried here and ask for salad with your burger.
EFOVNo26MCPe5dQC0HBifQ,m2QwIN6Lo91do9guB-woOg,rAyrzywxzUOLrhJ-fmrcgA,4,Nothing fancy but all very honest..Great beer choice..Burgers are a sure bet. The curry is also decent..What you see is what you get which is getting more and more rare these days..Only expect a decent pub with beer and pub food.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,gI64F7jShI4NfEjV0JsnEA,3,OK; this place makes GREAT sushi BUT; there were some things that made the experience less than great - first of all; it's small and ALWAYS crammed to the rafters. You will be practically sitting on someone else's lap (ever wanted to know what it's like to do a double date with a couple of complete strangers?) and reservations are a MUST. Just don't even bother going without one. If you're lucky; you'll get one of the counter seats and be able to watch the sushi-making in action; but if not; prepare to be a little awkward and uncomfortable. OH; also important to note is that THEY ONLY TAKE CASH...For all of you Montreal Anglos like me; unless you are fluent in French; what you order will be a bit of a surprise - there is no English on the menus; not even in tiny print. I really had no idea what I was getting other than tuna and shrimp as the main ingredients. This was a wee bit frustrating and the staff was too busy to stop and explain anything to me; so I just did my best. Anyway; everything I got was pretty delicious and beautifully presented; so ultimately; *whatever*...Another thing that went awry is that we ordered a bottle of San Pelligrino with our sushi; which just never came. Missing part of the order is a big no-no in my books. Nobody came to check on our table after we received our order either; because they're just too busy; so we just went without. ..Next time; I think I'll order take-out; even though the décor is pretty exciting inside the restaurant if you like vintage ceiling clutter.

GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,oRuZb1QYxQhKzKXU5pPfdA,mdeLrfAtmXKRO_gOMvMtwQ,2,There's been a lot of hype about this place over the years but I never quite understood why. It's small; cramped; and doesn't have a liquor license. The food is OK; but unfortunately the same flavours come out in most of their sushi rolls; so one gets very sick of that mayo/tempura/secret sauce combo that seems to be everywhere. I never found the service to be that friendly either... There are much better experiences to be had at other sushi spots in the city.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,YOmyzxTFYULhTCHdDgWQRA,5DoNNkOf6X6_eNk0yC_zlA,3,Disappointing... I prefer Saint Sushi....Its more on the pricey side; and their rolls are just okay; nothing special. Ordered the chef's special and the tri roll (the one with rice paper) and they were not impressive. The sashimi with thin apple slices was really amazing tho..The decor was worth taking pictures haha
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,8PKD7rwNb19nXtaoZGXAUg,4,This has to be the tastiest sushi in Montreal by far.  I tried the omakase menu which is a tasting menu so we got to try a bunch of different types of sushi.   It is hard to pick a favourite kind but I think at the end of the day the salmon sashimi was the winner...The service was pretty quick however it was difficult to get the waiter's attention when he wasn't serving us dishes.  We were a group of 6 and they didn't bring enough soy sauce for us so not everyone got some.  When we tried to flag down the waiter for more we couldn't find him.  ..Take note that it is cash only and a very small place so reservations are an absolute must.  In my experience they do sittings so you have to be out by a certain time for the next group of people to come in.

Depuis mars; j'y suis allé 2 fois (à emporter); et j'ai été déçue à chaque fois.

GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,YP5hNfCZruMdByn6Ah6XpQ,dMJ0HTCTRvCDpj_X9xm_MQ,5,Lurking behind an unassuming exterior and an incongruous kitschy diner-like interior lies one of Montreal's best sushi restaurant. I had wandered by it numerous times thinking it was just another generic sushi take-out joint that now litter the city before finally inspecting it closer. I noted the packed crowds inside and the glowing write-ups on the door and thought it must be one of those hidden gems that only people in the neighborhood know about. Turns out I was wrong. Montreal sushi aficionados know Tri's work (Tri is the name of the sushi master chef) from two high end places he worked at before opening his own place. Considering the cramped and unglamorous interior; the place is not cheap (it probably rivals more expensive sushi restaurants in Montreal like Shodan or Maiko and a very basic dinner for two with the simplest combination plate will run about $70) but the sushi is better than any I had in the city. The fish is incredibly fresh; the presentation is beautiful; and the combination of flavors and textures are truly impressive. It's my new favorite sushi place in town.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,fHG0UALsw91_EhbQFL9oXg,__blqga26HPfZNSGvnUULg,2,We tried two sushi rolls and some sashimi and tartar. It was good but nothing special. The service is not very friendly and they give you a pen to pick your choices. I made a trip to this place after receiving a recommendation from a friend but I don not recommend it nor will I ever come back. The menu is also just in French and they don't have an English menu. I also thought that the fish was not very fresh. The items are expensive too for the quality.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,GlhB2gBpVN0hGAa8sAup9A,fQgQWsHx2-EdjXBVaDqB1A,5,Great sushi for the price. We always go for the tasting menu and leave full with our pockets still heavy with cash. I must tri.

If you're into pairing wine with your sushi; this ain't the place for you..*RESERVE YOUR PARTY. It's highly advised that you call ahead to avoid the wait...Peep the photos in my review and you'll regret not coming sooner. FYI; your honored cutie will be mesmerized with the decor and vibe. Style and cool points are definitely in your future my friend...Tri Express and I have quite a few things in common. We are both nestled in a hipster village; rich in texture; small in stature but full in flavor; and are both accessible by the Orange Line; Tri via STM in The Plateau (Laurier); and me via MBTA in Jamaica Plain. That only means one thing: We were absolutely destined to cross paths and culinarily knock boots; with the aid of some chop sticks. Kinky I know...The staff here are very personable and easy to spark a conversation with. The sushi chefs suggested spots to hit that locals frequent for a nights worth of some good times. You guys were great! We'll meet again very soon.....*Beantowns Finest*

Get the omakase menu to go (no joke). Everything is expertly prepared and packaged; ready to handle the trek to your flat. The sushi is marvelously fresh; the sashimi heavenly; and the flavors creative (try the rice crackers topped with seafood). Plus; there's plenty of wasabi and ginger if needed...Bring cash.

GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,kWgw-pkV-HSP7K1vg9yvFg,uQPuhTR-XI-iBsCoF-SGig,1,Cheap on the meat & bad service..Although the presentation was decent; the amount of fish in every dish was very disappointing. Even worse; it looks like they're trying to hide this through more starch in the tartare; and rice in the sushis...The waitress was also very rude and impatient...Will not go there again.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,7ITL2fpnETneAMsHyvnlYw,-RTXu7pE3lrtF-cEcMAtEQ,2,After reading the reviews I figured this place was amazing. .. turns out it's  NOT! .. place is so small when you walk in your breathing all over people's food and vice versa. I had no idea who was our waitress or waiter 3 different people came to our table. First they place us in a corner and forget about us; we change places; order our food; just as there's 2 sushi left ; I find a hair at the bottom of my plate.  I signal a waiter; he leaves with the plate; another waiter comes back with the plate asking us if it's our plate; he then tells us it's not my hair. We answer its not ours either he then leaves and brings us more sushi. I ask for a coke; he literally gives me a can; I ask for a straw we have no straws so we ask for a glass and finally brings it. Food was ok but service was horrible. We had to ask for every single thing we wanted; no service at all. Debated between this place and Mikasa. Should have went to Mikasa instead. Definately not a returning customer.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,1oj3iR03QOq1Tcqg5OO_Vg,o9Gq04_lNuF0YLDpzyh-AA,5,I relish visiting Montreal because of Tri Express. I've been tempted to buy a plane ticket just to eat there. Chef Tri is the rockstar of the sushi world and I'm totally and unabashedly a groupie. I don't throw my panties at him when he's making sushi but the food is that good that I've been tempted too. I first encountered his genius ingredient pairings when he was at Kaizen and also at Le Petit Treehouse but I much prefer his latest incarnation at Tri Express. C'est magnifique!..Tips: Go with a few people (max 4... the tables are tiny!) and order Omakase III. It is the best way to experience his mastery at work.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,w01hd3eejoOkE6kQ9Q4g9A,AETgxU_CZdoByyfbcpTxEg,5,Great sushi place. ..Great prices. ..Superbe location. ..Friendly staff. ..We can order too..Be careful as this place doesn't serve alcohol. But to be honest I like it that way. It keeps the price down. ..The decor is very unusual for a sushi place but that is why I like about it. ..I just love the place as going there or takeout for eating in the nearby park.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,47wyGt5l_lt8v0NIDbvCDg,oOCJ_8bxAtRXC050doRyEQ,1,Not safe for Celiac's or gluten intolerant!!..I called to know if it was a safe place for gluten free rolls. I told them I was celiac. The person on the phone assured me the rolls I ordered would be gluten free. Right before finishing my second roll My stomach started to feel weird so I left my last roll. I then asked if I had any imitation crab in my roll and they assured me it was gluten free. I then asked To see the ingredients label on the crab sticks and there it was wheat was on the label in the ingredients list!!!! .Even the sauces looked questionable! They don't even have gluten free soy sauce. ..AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST IF YOU ARE CELIAC OR INTOLERANT TO GLUTEN! ..THEY DONT KNOW WHAT GLUTEN IS! ..THEY DID NOTHING TO CORRECT THE SITUATION; STILL CHARGED ME FOR IT.  AND NOW I FEEL SICK!! ..Thanks Tri Express! Thanks so much! I will Remember you.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,G422ejyfziG2xOtqgyKDWg,-vA4HNvfkO5L5vNdf9ZUTg,3,There's been a buzz about this restaurant for years but I've never been until today. I really liked it! It definitely has that cool Plateau vibe. Like everybody says; the place is really small and really buzzing (do take out if you are a group of more than 4). We had the chef special; which was about a selection of best sushis/dishes. The food was fresh; inventive and delicious. ..Montreal doesn't have a great selection of Japanese restaurants compared to other places I've been. However; Tri is probably one of the best in the city.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,c8Ymo6xaxz3JI3u6oTVerw,MsaDxrecezq2PgidSxALJg,5,Dnsjahwidnemsknegngnrjejebrbw..THIS PLACE IS JUST AMAZING. I have never tried sushis as good since I've been in Vancouver . .Not much picture because I was with a group of people and it looked too odd! Yeah I'm old fashion ; I have to let others enjoy their food before harassing them for a picture ... ..Anyway ; the restaurant is mad busy so don't bother coming without a reservation if your party is more than three. THEY STILL DO OFFER TAKEOUTS ; y'all should take that in note :) ..I'm a bit biased as I was invited for an event that was pretty made by the son's owner . However ; the cuisine and the food was impeccable ; I think I'm pretty much in one with that place . Service is very efficient and fast . ..The crowd is young ; trendy and hipster . But no worries everyone is accepted in this place ; they will still serve you with a big smile hehehe...Food is great ; or A to the M TO THE A TO SO ZINGGGGG ; can you hear me now ? It's just freaking amazing . Y'all gotta try the salad cause the sauce tastes so good and me likes when it melts within mah mouth ...The rolls are huge and very well made ; I am saying this as I have experienced Vancouver Japanese cuisine and this is on par ! Did you hear me yelper? IT IS ON PAR!..Okay me thinks I'm going a little crazy ; but tri express is definitely a must try in term of sushi WITHIN MONTREAL ...Worry less about my words ; and go discover this charming place . Hey I'll for sure become a regular here :$
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,sOL82Hbfza89tKL6m_wBJA,G9ElPGZ3yPRmbgyhC3Agwg,4,My favorite sushi place in Montreal! I almost gave 5 stars; but there are small drawbacks--you have to pay cash; there are no desserts; we did not have much space to move around; and we waited close to 10 minutes for our table even with a reservation. But once you are sitting down; the service is fast; the staff is nice; and most importantly; the food is really delicious! I really liked the both the salad and the sushi. The decor is quite original for a sushi place. It's a good location--about 10 minutes away from Métro Laurier; and I really enjoy walking down Laurier street anyway :) I will definitely go back.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,7hElQBiE_x2HZk6yJMVgNg,cMeJhAzw77tvonjJz90IVA,4,love it its the same quality everytime i go i find that it can also hurt since i hace been so many times and its always the same menu and sushi in mtl is always changing so gotta keep up
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,pejXy09k_nGQsj0R0gXPyQ,_dum7CJh7wsspPtJxN4H2Q,5,Définitivement les meilleurs sushis que j'ai jamais mangé jusqu'à aujourd'hui ! Et pour un prix très correct :Nous étions 6 et avons eu droit à une explosion de saveurs et de couleurs pour 25$/pers dans une cadre très original et chaleureux...Essayez; c'est même pas la peine de réfléchir!
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,aNfG4yqETNKXNQgc2qTToA,V7Ji6DI73pH7MtLI8EsJXg,3,Three of us tried the $25 tasting menu. It was a good price but nothing was like WOW. It seemed like this place have a lot of deliveries as the waiters were pretty busy most of the time. This is definitely a good sushi place for delivery standard; but maybe not worth the effort to go in and sit down for their food. .This place does not offer authentic sushi. They put avocado in every roll; which I don't like at all. .Their new style sashimi was good; creatively topped with some apple added some unique flavour. But everything else was just so so.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,B3hW460-AHikKgfxoc3KKw,ik25JKsc0Ad_7SYQQ_v30Q,4,Ça faisait un bout que je n'avais pas mangé d'aussi bons sushis. J'ai adoré la déco; mais encore plus les tartares!
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,Xr-xohBaLoCTem7lf77_LA,TLXmaHscK4HyVML_7NIO4g,5,1. Book a reservation.2. Show up on time.3. 3 mins later you have the menu and water.4. 10 mins later you ordered .5. 15 minutes later you eat..But I could wait much longer cause it's too good...Fast; quality seafood; clean; stylish and give a good tip...I went multiple times and it's always good!! This is a gem on the plateau; please go!!..Small restaurant; big bathrooms :)
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,ZD76B53WiEdv3g2lNgTbNg,_cMOp7D8H6KX0dQSioeohA,3,J'aurais mis 3.5 mais je souhaiterais y retourner et manger dedans pour me refaire une idée car là on a pris à emporter. On a attendu 30 minutes pour la commande et on l'a mangé au Parc Laurier...Il y a des sushis/makis vraiment originaux et qui changent des classiques que l'on retrouve un peu partout. Il y en a pour tous les gouts; différents type de poisson et certains épicés. C'est bon mais je pense que mon opinion a été biaisé par le fait de le manger dans le parc sans le confort d'un restaurant...Je ferais une MAJ quand on y retournera et qu'on mangera sur place...A restester :)
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,Sd357RRT7uLQ3v52aQaLqw,miQ6w6KZcycZ2v_A6gR42A,5,Just delicious! The omakase was nice; but there is an amazing dish of sashimi. There was nothing I was not satisfied with. I dare say it is among my top sushi restaurants that I have visited in my life. This place is cash only; and very busy -- make reservations ahead of time and bring cash..Note: there is not only no alcohol here; but it's also NOT byob.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,eFgauxNUbt9ZVtcnkM5yaw,s5dcHUR6iwtYefEgEKcKsQ,5,J'adore; le décore est super. Les plats sont d'une fraîcheur et d'un goût vraiment au top. On mange rapidement; il faut réserver; il y a beaucoup de monde. Un de mes restaurent la préféré de Montreal. Je recommande grandement.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,67ApT4A3MWaNTxpG6m1r8w,QOV-ONHLr7T80ZoKXxuCsg,5,WOW the sushi here was AMAZING!  I am still dreaming about it.  Next time I visit Montreal; I am definitely returning to Tri Express.  Great food; great service; really nice decor.  Such a small and cute restaurant; but I would recommend a reservation since it's tiny and it was PACKED when I was there.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,Q0V2EAK1Xj--Xmjjkpdh9Q,qaChyYUuEBbGQ_JKDe0g5g,4,Good sushi...we especially liked the chef specials and the salad.   Eclectic atmosphere....has a French cafe type feel.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,yz-eHwGxds7NVvCw2AGeaw,etGJroahhJQCO92qu-S5IQ,3,I was very conflicted by my experience at Tri Express. I am giving it a 3 star review based upon my overall experience...I state this because the service was vastly different from the quality of the food. Firstly upon arrival we were situated next to a window in the dead of winter and had to keep our coats on lest we freeze. We then had to ask our waitress twice to clean our table because after the first request she ran a wet cloth lightly over the table and left it half cleaned and sopping wet (picture posted). The service was 2 star. The food however rated a 4 star rating. Interesting and flavourful if lacking in originality...overall worth the trip.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,YheJrg5LWIVQpIUfGle-GQ,jdIswqvdF9Bl96JjYnf5eA,5,Ahhhhh the kind of sushi that you dream about day and night... Tri Express is THE place to get the best sushi at the most affordable price!!! Do reserve in advance if you want the awesome place at the bar. Or else; you can also call to take out!..And ask for the tasting menu (not the 5 services one!); they will bring you 3 to 4 dishes at around 20-25$ per person! And it would not be your boring everyday sushishop kind of sushi! no no no no! the sushis literally melt in your mouth! The rice is slightly warm and vinegary... hmmm and the fish is of course the freshest you can get. Their tuna carpaccio is served with sliced green apples and ginger with a fresh and delicious soya sauce. It will make you like your plate! Then you have the famous sushi pizza; which is a yummy and crispy mixture of lobster; tempura; caviar with their special sauce; served in a pyramid on a rice cracker! It is a party in your mouth!!!..My oh my; not enough good things can be said about this place! The service is top notch and efficient. The food absolutely the best. But they just accept cash. Meh. Fair enough. And do finish your meal by walking a few streets down to Bo Bec for an awesome ice cream :)
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,rtQ5gKz8982aja96EUMooQ,ZjDAABjLU_fvgP9K0uk7DA,4,My friend and I got the chef special 15 pieces.The salmon was very soft and fresh; it was melting by itself in our mouths.The service was good; a bit too fast even; they didn't want us to starve so every time we finished a place the next one was right in the middle of our table.We didn't know that they do not sell alcohol there; so we wanted to have sake and we finished by passing our tour as we didn't went to go out and buy something 3 blocks away where the Saq is located .Here is the hint; stop at the Saq before getting in
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,cDP4v_TQ4NFmwloP5a3wug,v88tgApTmokZ3kNW4UFp_g,5,Best sushi in town. It's an old school diner converted into a sushi restaurant; and all the decorations were created by the main man Tri himself; and there's an absolute Plateau charm to the place...And the food--well; like I said; best sushi in town. Pricey? Budget between $30-40 per person. And make a reservation if you're there for a Thursday; Friday; or Saturday night.
GuAa3tTE3zSr05sUOQYXzA,u7fT7qDPbj8nfZMS5ZiIdw,XnUdn6aj4K53mbHS9olUpQ,4,Best sushi I've had in Montreal..We usually take a set menu at 25$ which gets us the lot: sushi tartare; sashimi; sushi; maki. Always leaving with a very full stomach..Always very fresh and the service is quick..I would advise to make a reservation even if you go on a week day as the place is tiny and fills up very quickly. Also; they only take cash.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Ap6hDeelMkaqaO0Jp0RmbA,Ma0GC36C29SrUlwPLgeaGg,5,Enjoyable experience! Great food; beer and service.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Pl2dmmFEWqWV3-KvsYuayw,tl50mAprjGWCFk7OP8lMFA,1,We visited this establishment after a recommendation with a friend. In all honesty I would have rather gone home and cooked my own meal...We arrived and waited roughly five minutes at the door to be seated. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating (some of our party spoke english only; some french). ..We were seated next to the kitchen doors and our server came; made some beer recommendations and took out drink orders. We were not asked if we wanted water; no forks or knives; napkins were given. ..After about 15 minutes our drinks FINALLY arrived; only delivered by a different server. He gave us our drinks and walked away. We had to call him back to place our food orders. The entire time we were ordering he was rude.He made rude comments under his breath when HE misunderstood what someone was trying to order; when asked to make an order without onions he replied very rudely that If it's on the menu than that's what comes on it; We do not make substitutions at all...We are roughly a 25 minutes into our dinner experience now. No water; No napkins; no drink refills;  nothing. ..Ten minutes later the awful server returns with place mats; forks and knives. One of our party asks for a napkin as her drink was sticky and making a mess. He turns his mats over to show he has napkins; rolls his eyes and scoffs...The starter comes; and it was cold. Honestly I wasn't surprised...Finally our food arrives (brought out by the kitchen staff? not the waiter?). 2 orders of fish and chips (cold); A texas burger with cold greasy onion rings on top and cold fries; a California Burger with ice cold fries;soggy bun; and a black slice of avocado. .I would have complained but surprise surprise; our server was nowhere to be seen...We finished eating and a DIFFERENT server came to collect our dishes; offered us another drink; desert and coffee. She was very friendly and if I could have tipped her and the hostess I would have. ..I will never be returning to this establisment ever. I will tell anyone who asks about it to avoid it like the plague. I have had a better dining experience at Burger King. ..In short; Terrible food and even worse service.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,nZKc_pVUaeEML0PGzwVMyA,LACUwsRaM0J51i0ByvtL7g,4,Quite an enjoyable bar/dining scene; very vibrant place..It was packed but we didn't wait for too long fortunately..Had the LA Wrap with coffee. It was okay but a bit dry in the middle..Service was good. All and all not the best or my favourite but not too bad.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,NLJT8SQ1f0YpxO4hFUPdrw,FC2fM39JeHKoqk_lFw8OVQ,2,This has got to be the weirdest waitressing experience I have ever had. ..This was the Friday lunch with the colleagues. We get to the main entrance and ask if there is room on the terrace. Response: No. You have to go all around to McGill College and ask yourself. ..We get to terrace and ask the waitress if there is room on the terrace. Response: No. ..We then ask her if there is room in the main restaurant. Response: No. You have to ask yourself. ..What kind of restaurant does not have a communication system of some sort where waiters can ask each other whether they have tables left?! ..Moving on. We get a table inside. We managed to order our food very quickly. I asked for no tomatoes on my burger and yet I got them. My colleague asked for no onions on her sandwich and yet she got them. We asked a busboy to give us some forks and knives. He said: Ask your waiter. In the end; we got them OURSELVES and I noticed how it made our waiter a little nervous.  ..The food: My burger was a little dry. I make better burgers than this one and yet I am not a fantastic cook. I think my colleagues liked their pizzas. It was definitely overpriced. I'm not a beer person but the people who had a beer said they were average. ..Conclusion: Will not go back unless someone asks me too; because there is a hockey game on or something. Actually; I would probably try to convince them to go elsewhere. ..P.-S. When you leave the restaurant there is a little station where you can press a button to show your (dis)satisfaction. Needless to say we all pressed the red :( button very enthusiastically.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,A29aNoQCw7m-7uZxkIqjWg,TUzuCrHBsE-W-DtDO37x1g,5,I give this place five stars just for the beer battered maxi fries. Nice selection of beers and I liked that they gave pairing recommendations for each menu item. We got their flatbreads -- I highly recommend the artisanal meat one. Overall; tasty and filling food; fair prices; and great service.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,sLhx_e9CveYKWQXUzUeCfg,qRv75-kK5kvbh0WgW3b-Hw,3,Been here a few times already in the last 2 years. The drinks are good; beer. The sangria here is made mostly of juice then a hint of wine. It's kinda funny to see they bring the pitcher to the table then stir it for you. Ordered the burger; asked for it medium; was told no. MadCow Disease is still a risk ( apparently; ugh scary) .Service is slow and not attentive. Good for a quick bite and absorbing the cold air conditioning.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,HfP1HVRlpfO0gcfJ3NJApA,5Ovab5djvnMrY8vO8SOPYw,3,Just found out about their happy hour actually (5 dollar pints!) I usually steer clear of this place in the summer because they pack the tables and chairs on the terrasse which leaves you with no elbow room for a game of charades (jk with the charades... but def not comfy enough for me)..We sat inside; filled up quickly around 5:30 and our waitress was super duper nice. ..Didn't eat anything but we got a free basket of chips and salsa and the seasonal pint was interesting enough. She said all the pints were on special so it's a win for all sorts of taste buds.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Q4Dcsdke_u6Rt01MWCy1GQ,sgVZWr0fSXmUOtyWjWl4oA,5,On a weekend in Montreal; my boyfriend and I stumbled on this restaurant. We went in after looking at the menu and deciding it could be good. The beer was great- they brew it themselves and it had a good flavor. We got poutine and split one of the flatbreads. Everything was absolutely delicious! The wait staff was also very friendly and helpful with tips on where to go around the city. I would come back here on my next trip to Montreal!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Il6EI3rmQjI9p6BPt-OhRA,tpdwAGjg8_fnz1w_AlkUnw,4,Chicken and waffles sandwich was very good.  There was a wait but it moved as expected; and the food was served in a reasonable amount of time after ordering.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,PVOtG_2eJOnJLoLmT_rQig,_zxX7T1Cs-F9LtQOAMSNOQ,4,This location on St. Catherine is simply a better choice for this chain. The seating was efficient. Our server was prompt (despite how busy it was); and both personable and courteous! His recommendations for steak (and their preparation) was great; and we were immensely satisfied! The creme brûlée was not as expected; but it was decent. Not a bad experience at all.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,EW57x_yE6gsy86nhJTRuPg,sGZ5GiA5cnbV6GxDR8XSUg,5,This was our first time in Montreal and walking we came across this restaurant. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the steak along with a sangria and IPA beer. We thought everything was really tasty! Satisfied and portions are decent. The menus are made made like a little magazine which is unique. We would come back.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,TneEXk98j-L7L_fRoKARzw,BPYFeKgSfw2XiXcGq5G8vg,4,Went to 3 Brasseurs on a recommendation while in town for work. Happened to be during game 1 of Stanley Cup Finals with Montreal playing Ottawa. Great atmosphere for a game. Staff was friendly and the food & drink was good!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,CtBx4yk_QM8ClITgw94TPQ,R3dhPR3UNg4QEni37s7uiQ,3,I am a regular at 3 Brasseurs. It's a nice place to go with clients or friends. Their beers are pretty good - never life changing; but always good. The menu is overall good; but not spectacular. The Flamms are indeed good; easy to eat and never too filling because they are so thin; but the rest of the menu is... Bof. Burgers are typically overcooked. I'd recommend if you're in the mood for pub food with drinking buddies.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,EblK20dUUogxra1VI23BGQ,Z--inkqjotuOo12TjwJkdg,3,Decent pub grub for all. ..Service is a bit slow but the food is ok. ..We tried the french onion soup; Poutine and salads along w cassoulet. Everyone enjoyed their food. ..They have many beers to choose from. Good place if u appreciate that.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,aNmrSw98PhdvZkLgxP2PWg,TAUmm0yGSCROmZcjjLiK2Q,3,The service was alright but got the flammekueches and it was very delicious. The ambience and overall atmosphere is fun and a lot of menu options to choose from. I would return to perhaps try one of their burgers.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,wdI2C_7rI6xu2WDYfp9vYw,BC1QZHLr0fBBKadRWmZ2Hw,2,I would have given this place one star except the place has good service...I had the burger (cooked with biere blonde) with fries and their sampler beers...The burger was way over-cooked and the bun was pretty hard. I guess this is what they consider toasted.  The fries were actually good though...As for the beer sampler (there were 4); nothing to write home about especially for a brewery in Canada--land of beer...Again; the service was good for a semi busy night which was appreciated.  I can't blame the servers for the lack of experience in the kitchen.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Bxuk7yuvCZSp-zg0_dCSxg,UZHqUq3sl0WP7VVnIz3RCg,2,Our server ended up pouring the same beer a few times in our two flights even though we paid an up charge for the beer of the moment. Slow service. Frozen food. Wouldn't recommend; the beer is completely average and all of the cocktails poured looked half full.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,zF4F20s3LFi_-bYnOTmwwA,iuNZ_gVXz7XT5cs4mja8UQ,4,A simple idea but well executed - brewpub/sportsbar with good food (a specialty is  Flammekueche - an Alsatian dish meaning literally Flame cake - or in mainstream French tarte flambée; which is a similar to a pizza but without the tomato-centricity)...Good selection of well kept beers too.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Pweu9e19-LfISe-47Q2WVQ,GkHaoH1lkrr2QkWuhQziug,4,Is a good option is clean and nice place. have a good bar fare. the beer is very good and they make their own beer. the poutine was very good. and the staff was helpful.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,ZY6sK9n9d40tTwLfa2s66w,8eA1e-wBX0hlG6yvlBIFbA,4,All what i was expecting from a brewery. Good beer; decent burger; nice waitress... What does a men more need?
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,wNgCoH8qlfTxAV_z11wGYQ,brhrqxSiaPqwYJxjjVZUYg,3,I've ate at les trois brasseurs several times in the past but this time didn't enjoy it very much. The portion size has definitely gone down. I ordered the trois brasseur burger and it comes with a tiny bowl of fries. In the last there used to be a fairly large portion of fries and now it is very little. I was still hungry after eating and needed to order an appetizer. The appetizers are over priced compared to most restaurants as well. I may go back someday if I have friends going but definitely would not make it top of my list. Oh and I was given such a small amt of sauce that I didn't have enough for the burger itself :( The waitress didn't come around much and only seemed friendly when it was time to pay bill because of the tip probably.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,x_RnrZm7bfS4U31Bz_1jIA,f59LVpK8f3I3NG5FQQm0zQ,2,Definitely nothing special about this place. It's a chain restaurant; and you can definitely tell by the lack of quality and good management. ..I've actually been to Les Trois Brasseurs more times than I can count; but that says nothing about my lack of affection for the establishment. I've gone so many times because I live only a few blocks from their locations on St. Catherine and it's one of the closest places to go watch a hockey game and grab a drink. ..The food is lackluster pub food. I usually get a chicken and pesto flamm since it's one of the healthiest items on the menu. Portion sizes are huge for Quebec standards; but not anything special. They do brew their own beer; which I can appreciate; but Quebec has far better beers to offer at other local brewpubs. ..My main issue with Les Trois Brasseurs is that they have consistently terrible service. On several visits we have waited over an hour for our food. More than once we have ordered a beer and had it not come until well after our food was served. Forgetting our order; not bringing something we asked for; or bringing us the wrong order is a usual occurrence...My advice; go to Les Trois Brasseurs if you're out of other options. Otherwise; there are far better places to go to in the city.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,oAFOOGcRtgo1KuAypWHHBg,vhXk1yxHLakZ3qU-DU3j4A,2,Went here for some drinks with friends. Interestingly; for a pub-style restaurant; there was very little beer choices. Also; they did not serve Patron Silver; which kind of shocked me. The service was very slow. Our server spent more time trying to turn his tables instead of serving the customers who had been there for a while. Reading other reviews on here; it seems as if service speed is a problem. Still; it seemed like our server might have had too large of a section. The reason I give this place two stars instead of one is because the food was pretty good. Still; nearly took 45 minutes for a calamari appetizer to come out; which is ridiculous. This place has a lot of potential; but there are some obvious problems.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,HsTEfv2QiJBI1VclnVsxnQ,vHb95kwpo38MDdBO_Z0zOQ,3,The Flamm (flat bread w/ cheese and toppings) was really good and so was the poutin (fries with cheese curds and gravy) but I agree w/ Holly T. this place was like corporate chain acting like a local pub or micro brewery. I probably won't go back to Les Trois Brasseurs just because of the corporate-feel of the place...They have four beers they make; a white; an amber; a brown and a blonde beer. The prices were sort of middle of the road prices; not super affordable but not overpriced either. All in all; just skip it.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,8TQ4QWrbS6nKvQAjvQMbug,ZRPAwaDwvwTrVO1oZFNidQ,3,We were two hot and tired tourists who needed to eat RIGHT NOW. We were on St. Catherine's.  The place we'd planned to dine at was closed.  We were seated; and I almost thought it was a mistake to come here. It looks like an aging Bennigans.  I was ready to bolt when our waiter came to take care of us.  I am glad we stayed.  Our flatbread style pizza was delicous!! The crust was thin; and the cheese had a delicous flavor that mixed nicely  with the vegetables on the dish.  We also had salad (ok for 3.49) and onion rings.  My dining partner ordered the onion rings; and it wasn't until the bill came that I saw the price:  8.99!!!! Our server stated that it was because it was real beer batter.  Well; I still don't think that justifies 8.99 for onion rings!! At any rate; it was a solid choice that afternoon.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,65mtqTog-6ja32QG34KiGg,y7rRA5Kbdhp5Y20jBI5KgQ,2,Hmm... out of 10 or so reviews; more than half of them are from non-Canadians. That paints a pretty good picture of what Les Trois Brasseurs is like; which is like a Canadian version of TGIFridays (minus the flair). I went to the Vieux Montreal location; which had a really nice patio on the sidewalk. The service wasn't snooty or pushy; although my server did ask me if I wanted an English menu before I sat down (is it that obvious? Maybe my American flag fanny pack is a little too big)...The poutine; which is the main reason I came here; was alright; but not stellar. Maybe it was because I'd never had poutine before and have nothing to compare it to; but it just seems like mediocre fries soaked in gravy; covered in cheese curds. I mean; tasty as hell; but... ten minutes later; do I really want soggy fries smothered in a liquid heart attack? The Caesar salad was redeeming because it came with; as all things Canadian; a hearty portion of bacon. As for the beer; which is brewed on premises; I cannot comment on it; as I foolishly ordered a beer cocktail (peach schnapps mixed with 'La Blanche' - very light wheat and barley malt beer... never again)...Sitting outside probably makes it seem less corporate; for what it's worth.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,oAFOOGcRtgo1KuAypWHHBg,gl4YQhYGLGj6H679vaJUPQ,4,Came here again...improved quite a bit. Maybe it was just the server we had the last time I was here; but this time they were quick an attentive. Food was spot on; and also the drinks came out quickly. It still isn't an amazing place; but it is good pub food with a German twist to it.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,O-7y0Ep03Nu0JLo6xuJahw,6L5WcpWdEs8SXOyzvmwYfw,2,I was in Montreal last weekend to race. Came here with a few friends/team mates to have dinner. We strolled around the town and stumbled upon this restaurant. .The service was definitely friendly and accomodating. The food was eh...I ordered Les Brasseurs Burger-with cheese; bacon; lettuce; tomatoes; - can't go wrong right?.WRONG. I asked if I can have the burger cooked medium rare and was told it's always cooked the same. That should've been a sign.  Everything about my burger was fine except for the meat. It clearly wasn't a fresh made beef patty; looked like some compacted processed bits. The best part of our meal with the thin crust pizza we all ordered as an appetizer- that was topped with mushrooms; meat; onions and gruyere. May not consider this the next time we are here.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,5o05OPIAhp5oAs7E6a9JNQ,e_qjisZe6v5e22ryr--rqA,3,We had traditional sauerkraut; cassoulet;and snacks with beer for lunch. Beer is good but the food is a bit overpriced. The cassoulet looks like smaller than menu.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,YH9KASgyJt69xhP22E3uFQ,jhz5QuXLsZrnMTMrqvJm4A,4,Great amber ale and slow roasted pork shank was good and tasty but had more fat than meat; came with mashed potatoes; sauerkraut and vegetables.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,175HdA_nJxsR42steUiIXg,M7DXd22yWszyylvnMPHqCA,3,The food is decent; nothing much to crave but good to have a drink with a friend; if it is something to be desired.  I think the only reason I go here is usually because I want to share a drink with friends; not really to eat the food.  If I wanted eat; I usually share a dish of nachos with friends but that is about it.  The restaurant is always busy and almost always crowded and busy.  Usually; I don't really see the waitress much other than when being asked what the order is and when to pay.  I'm usually not asked if things are going well or not; but probably that's because the waitress is so busy waiting on other tables and bringing food to other tables as well.  I think if there weren't such a variety of drinks; especially pitchers of drinks to share with friends; I wouldn't dine at the restaurant.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,ZjluCW8S2AIIfRvIeHgdxg,c_RTle1H-K1DzWbrAnmwrQ,3,Les Trois Brasseurs is a great spot to go if you're looking for the sure thing. You're not going to leave Les Trois with a different perspective on life or what it means to have a good meal. However; they are sure to offer something that you'll enjoy; they have a good selection of beverages to choose from; and the service is solid. The place was packed the night I visited and from the looks of things everybody was having a great time. The location is perfect and you really can't go wrong with Les Trois.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,fQcfRZkcOO-MXFYD5umf2w,gaI-RNaf6FH6N2L1Bip6Vw,3,I had the french pizza thing; and it was pretty good.  Other people's food looked nice as well.  Overall the place is alright; and the prices are fair for a glorified bar downtown.  You won't leave hungry as the portions are nice.  It's a neat place to check out and its a microbrew; but it didn't impress me much.  It's good for groups who want to have some beers and grab a bite.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,HlzN1RZBamCssbF_SvVgjA,x0NY2HhWL5G0CncC7WDtyw,2,Appetizer was good; bruschetta; but the entrees kept coming out barely warm.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,cUKuQRcr7Ln6GwDZrRHdwg,FifcAkISkHkehQNYYuKXUQ,4,Great ambiance; friendly staff; good drinks and great food. This is a good location and I love going there. This is the place to go for a beer on a nice summer night. The place is a little small so people are close together and the music is very loud so I wouldn't go there for a romantic date but rather for a good time out with friends. Beer is very good and the food was ok. I tried the flamms (thin pizza) and I wasn't impress at all with them.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,DChlTqxlUZmchI-xN3j1kw,WBnxl9rXpyaemSEJkuEqRw,2,Mediocre food in downtown Montreal. My sandwich was good but obviously the beef was several hours old and my french fries were clumpy (sorta stuck together in one big clump). Most likely they were old too...The service was quick and friendly and there are several locations. I wouldn't go back; too many other better places.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,o2T2dKDEhaMp_kagvqVuww,uBPORY3mAwcRYkgEylEalA,4,Since they brew their own beer here I was motivated to order the blonde; it was light and smooth! To keep things traditional we ordered the poutine and added the beer battered potatoes to it; and it was great! For the main course I went with the beef sandwich which was also very savory and flavorful and a guarantee that you will not leave there hungry. The only thing the service is very relaxed; thus you'll need a minimum of 1 1/2-2 hours to enjoy your meal.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,RO55qRu4TvHogzSOGERxKA,Z3hwEX4LbxiOvSZIW6dL_g,3,Came here for a friend's birthday dinner and the staff was very accommodating for the large group. The atmosphere is really great but the food was a bit overpriced and lacking any real flavor. The best part of my meal was the beer-battered fries which came with a great dip but the main that I had which was the chicken avocado sandwich was just mediocre and definitely not worth $16 bucks. I recommend the place if you aren't looking for any great food but just want a nice place to hang out with friends.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,iYn3XU1MA998g6QQSY_Lrg,E3qgkcrTCfSzIJWcjzu_5g,1,No one to seat us while we were waiting at the entrance. Walked in and took a seat and got a lecture from the server; who was kinda a bitch the whole time. Food was ok. A bit overpriced. Would likely never go again.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Ks9_P-SIdWnZmq-VXJuN5g,CqyUhJGHTzVE1F-WnjW7AQ,1,I am a long time 3 Brewers loyalty card owner with quite a lot of points. I finally write this review after consecutive visits to this place just to avoid any injustice. 3 Brewers is a chain with very good beer and; not fabulous; but decent food. Most of them are recommendable; friendly restaurants. Unfortunately; this branch; which is spoiled by undeserved attention mainly stemming from its central location; definitely a shame to the 3 Brewers brand. Lousy and slow service; terribly managed kitchen; snobbish and uptight managers can easily take the fun away from a lunch or dinner.  Try other 3 Brewers; for instance the one across the Apple Store on the same Rue Sainte-Catherine. You will see the difference.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,bfPbenPM7Wk5KGRm8SEtBg,d_YbEFc73MOcxhAS2FXeeQ,1,Went here on a Sunday night with a friend after work. I'm all about pub food and after a long day; I was looking forward to drinks and something greasy and delicious to comfort me...Our server was really fantastic; honestly the highlight of our stay at Les 3 Brasseurs. she was quick; courteous; and let my indecisive friend and I take our time ordering...My friend got the dijon mussels and they were pretty delicious. She loved them and the one she let me try was great. ..I; on the other hand got the Texas burger with a side of fries. For $13.25 I expect a certain quality of burger... What I received was a dry; pre-formed patty  which was smaller than the bun with a heap of shredded lettuce; mushrooms; fried onions (the best part of the burger). I can't know; because I don't work in the kitchen; but I am fairly certain this patty came from frozen. I should have been concerned when the waitress didn't ask how I liked my meat cooked (medium rare; if you must know) but I recieved a burger done medium-well and it was absolutely dry. I couldn't finish it. I ate the fries; which were nothing to write home about either. They also forgot to include the jalapenos; which were supposed to come as a topping... I guess this kind of burger would be acceptable for a Harvey's or something; where you get what you pay for (6$ for a pre-formed patty and some fries) but for 14 bucks I'd much rather go to another pub where they will actually give me a decent; nay; excellent burger. There are plenty of pubs in the downtown core who charge similar prices and have MASSIVE; home-made burgers which can be cooked to your specifications. ..It was my first time there and; considering how many pubs and restaurants are in that area; I will never return.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,9DRiWsAzhbi5-Iu4By3ovA,wktplcXGJ6EeU3repdR_1A,3,I've had both good and bad experiences at a few of the 3 Brasseurs locations. Overall; the beer is pretty good. I'm not a big beer drinker; so those who are really invested in it probably won't be too impressed. For me; it just has to be cold and crisp. Their pitchers are also a great deal for a group of friends going out...The food has been tasty. I like the flamms; but it's better to just consider them as flatbread pizzas. I love the spicy sausage and pepper one; and it has been consistently delicious. I've also had really nice chicken Caesar salads; they throw some bacon in; and the lettuce has always been crispy and fresh. I had an incredible dessert once: just a simple apple pie and ice cream. So delicious. Unfortunately; it was seasonal and it wasn't there the next time I went back. I didn't expect this place to have great desserts; but I think they do...Other times; the food has been bad. I had a chicken sandwich that was bland and missing (expensive) ingredients; namely the avocado. I tried a bite of a mac n cheese sandwich and how on God's green earth can you take the cheese flavor out of cheese?! Completely flavorless...Service has also been hit or miss. I've had friendly; attentive service and I've had a waitress basically refuse to bring my visiting family English menus.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,SuaSo2i3CzcRd3BEaQm7YA,DX-0KscsuybIUktGqkBVmw,3,I went to Montreal for the first time - and not the last - from December 30 2017 - January 1; 2018; on a whim; with a boy I just started dating.  Having had poutine only once before - sac le blur! how is that? - and being of the mindset that my happy calories should be saved for french fries and cheese and not cookies and cupcakes; it became our intention to eat some Motha Effin' poutine before we left.  Besides; it's important to have goals; especially whilst traveling.  Poutine seemed to me to be a perfect guilty pleasure to end out the year; before diets and resolutions (bleh!) were to begin.  In my defense; I'll say the cold sort of forced us off of the street and into Les 3 Brasseurs on New Year's Eve for a late lunch. In general; I prefer to support a Mom and Pop establishment before some big corporate empire but I did not realize this was a chain and all over the city; until we drove around on New Years Day and passed half a dozen.  In hindsight; I feel like I was the unknowing tourist in Manhattan; eating at the Red Lobster.  ..The friendly hostess greeted us within seconds and seated us in under a minute.  Our waitress came over pretty quickly.  We each got a beer; and I was excited to try something new because they brew their own. My new friend got either an ale or a lager; I can't remember; but it looked and tasted like a Winter Warmer to me; which is neither ale nor lager.  I got their IPA; which did not taste like an IPA at all.  What was it missing? Oh; that's right.  Flavor!  In fact; I'd rather have had a Budweiser; and for you Budweiser drinkers; let me be clear; that's not a compliment. I had the thought to ask her if we got the wrong beers and then wussed out...The poutine we ordered was good; not great.  My expectations were too high.  Maybe they always are... They say the best things come to those who wait; and I guess we didn't wait long enough. The couple of days fantasizing about gravy-; shredded meat-; and cheese curd-covered french fries had gotten me all worked up for something that simply did not deliver.  The meat was aight; the gravy was meh - and might have been from a Heinz jar - the cheese curds were tasteless (am I the only one who thinks cheese should taste like something?) and I wish they were a little more room temperature. The fries; the foundation of the dish; in my mind; were nothing to write home about. This dish deserves fries made to order; with the skin on; browned to perfection.  You know what kind of fries I'm talking about; fry lovers. These fries were the palest yellow; tasty (I'm a food snob; but I'd eat any ol' fry off of the floor if it fell off a plate) but not worthy of such a dish. ..Our waitress was friendly. I appreciate that she checked in with us since a Food Runner; not she; had brought our food out.  The place was packed; the spirit merry; with most of the patrons bundled up in their coats; hats and scarves at the bar or at tables.  I'm glad we didn't get anything else.  I wouldn't go into one of these places again except to get a beer; and if I got a bad beer again; I'd speak up.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,R225MaCRYkuwUvARiG7BHQ,j2Kw0x897L_U61hOpjTuWA,3,This bar and pub was very close to the hotel where I stayed.  The food is great for pub food.  The chevre was delicious and the chicken European sandwich was just good.  The location is excellent and it has two large patios which face bustling streets.  The service was great as the waiter took his time go through the multiple beer options from this microbrewery .  We sat at the bar as the upstairs dining area seemed a bit stuffy...Overall a great place to meet friends for casual food on a weekend night in this area.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,09mlR7BwKg_eLODpazevng,ZQvtY2DkJCGfj8iVMvdfYw,4,Came here 2 or 3 times during my trip to Montreal in July.  Their specialty is beer; but I actually don't drink beer; I had their Pinot Noir wine (they only had one); which was fine.  The rest of the people I was with loved the beer which is why we kept coming back.  It's in a very central location near lots of shops/hotels/etc.  The first night I ordered some hot wings.  I'm used to the buffallo wings in America; and honestly these wings didn't match up.  They just weren't spicy; but overall they tasted good.  Good enough for me to eat the whole plate of 'em!  Another night I ordered garlic bread with cheese on top; and my friend ordered french fries.  The garlic bread was pretty good; but the french fries were exceptional!  It's funny to rave about fries; but honestly; they were great.  They tasted more like potato wedges; but they were in the typical fry shape.  Very flavorful!  ..The waiter/waitresses were all very nice.  We were at the bar the whole time; and we never had to wait long to order or be served; and they were fun to talk to :)  If there were a Les 3 Brasseurs in America; I'm sure it'd be one of my go-to spots!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,ejk3YLHEPk9u4M5BmXzeNg,-O15BlBvzyWHWGsFrjzU7w,1,Our server was terribly rude and slow. She was extremely defensive when my friends mentioned their nachos (2 separate orders that arrived simultaneously) were cold and the cheese had hardened. She said there is no way the nachos could be cold. They were. My friends were very pleasant about it and she was aggressive. I ordered a green salad to start and it was great. My main was the roast chicken. The beans were cooked perfectly; the mashed potato was delicious but half of the chicken breast was very dry. I really enjoyed the IPA and the Brown; but found the Amber tasted a bit off. I though it had a foul taste. One of my friends tried it and he agreed. I mentioned this to the server and she did not react; she just looked at me - no response.  She left the 90% full beer sitting on the bar; even after I told her I thought it tasted off and pushed it away from me. As we were finishing our last drink; the staff started cleaning the bar around us with a chemical cleaner / metal polish and it was so strong; our eyes started to water. We mentioned it to the server and she ignored us. A supervisor/manager walked by and we mentioned that maybe they should wait until the establishment closes before breaking out the chemical cleaning agents. He said I know it smells bad; and I am sorry for that. Smelling it isn't harmful for you; but you shouldn't eat it. I have been working here for 5 years and it hasn't killed me.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,ZfN9YBytulx7wdf17hnTxA,KfeA7yRpBWDfg1i8FJn3NA,1,Service désagréable. .J'ai commandé des macaronis au bacon; j'ai eu des serpentini sans bacon. .Le burger de mon ami était très sec; plus que limite. .La moitié de mon assiette a été renversée lors du service (là n'est pas le problème; l'erreur est humaine); mais la serveuse a mis une bonne dizaine de minutes à compenser son erreur. .Nous ne recommandons pas.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,CIwG3po9GGIk7R26edZ3xA,Hjcp-wwBdLh38HCIBGsrHA,5,We were a little bit obsessed with this place. We came here numerous times on our most recent trip to Mtl; and we had visited in previous years as well. The beer keeps us coming back; namely the seasonal raspberry wheat! A lovely refreshing beer for the summer. We came just my fiancé and I; and also with a group of friends a few times. We always enjoy the food; and we've tried quite a bit of the menu. Burgers; flatbread pizzas; mussels; calamari; onion rings; pretzels; poutine; etc! Everyone enjoyed it here. The service was mostly excellent; a few better than others of course. We miss this place already; there aren't many microbreweries at home in Newfoundland!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,h8xB2s5u6fqCLYM5szNIgg,Sq6RxpYOhvMVpjwc0H_kPA,2,Stopped in for a drink and the girl behind the bar was miserable. Not sure if it is because we don't speak French but after forgetting our order then second beer was overflowing so she just put a napkin under it - not impressed.  Good thing the beer is good.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,XOF4-BgGkYakGaNH1N5BEQ,2wNdxwbELiHH8d8M0wI7tA,5,Super ambiance; super bières; très bonne cuisine style brasserie ...
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,AFgaTNtpoDO13A3Zt4Vphw,0t4mvvwsPQ1QJeBsg7Qj7Q,5,Visiting Montreal with my friends we decided to stop by this cool microbrewery. Food and brew was amazing!..- BBQ Chicken flatbread pizza.- Poutine w/pulled pork and cheese curds.- French Dip
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,1lEtYc8xcUt_r8n2WoYXKA,Bq3Qe-oMCARphbBYa4TARA,5,Las pizzas y los nachos son muy ricos. Sin duda es un buen lugar para echarte unas chelas y cenar antes de empezar la fiesta
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,ayzuc0rCgXXpyd0nARzHwg,HoF0V1K4jNDvV0KEGko-Dw,4,3 brasseurs burger is good. It has maple syrup in it; gives it a nice balance of sweet n salty. Our server was really friendly and accommodating too. He asked us if we want our bill split even though we didn't ask abt it.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,VFLmf0iImwfN4YEKargcxg,tb9vCAydpc3xCR_UVTkdKw,4,We were looking for some new place after the museum and knew St Catherine street had lots to choose from.  We saw this place and decided to give it a try.  Great flat bread pizzas and appetizers.  They have a huge menu and we enjoyed everything that we ordered.  I think this place is good for drinks and after hours libations.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,StP93sGeoM7vt5K5-vlUEw,xHsGHIt7CaZRHa6oivA47g,3,Liked their pork shank; the fish and chip are not so good; the salad and fries are also just so so
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Bl98NAmKPvCRi-Z5U2atWA,poZTOG5G9UQF0xLwaV2HXA,4,Woah!.Je suis allée souvent aux 3B et ce n'était pas ma première visite à cette succursale; mais j'ai essayé pour la première fois la poutine au canard confit et ouf lala; un vrai délice! J'en aurais pris un tiers de plus pour combler complètement mon appétit; ne serait-ce qu'en ajoutant une petit portion de frites. Nous étions quatre; deux d'entre nous ont pris un burger des 3B; qui est un burger assez traditionnel. Un p'tit punch de plus pour qu'il se distingue serait intéressant! Très bon; toutefois. ..La Stanley Stout (bière de quartier) est à essayer pour les amateurs de bière plus foncée. Je n'étais pas une grande fan des bières des 3B jusqu'à ce que je goûte cette dernière. C'est avec une stout qu'ils m'ont eue; qui l'eût cru! Vraiment; je l'ai trouvée excellente...Service correct; la serveuse s'assure qu'on a tout ce qu'il faut lorsqu'on reçoit nos assiettes et repasse une fois pendant le repas. Les desserts me semblaient peu attrayants; peut-être qu'un visuel m'aurait mis l'eau à la bouche.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,RFQ2Z1zZ2z85z89m_j0jXg,8YUbbAsXbsRzQlGqWRYyIw,4,Very good pub food! Great server super friendly. .Comfortable seating and great beer selections.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,haxmVAS6BoN853a6yx2y3A,G7ZhY-rVOjcz8eHoAYBkVg,5,Loved this place! Our bartender looked like Leelee Sobieski and was really chill and attentive. All the bar staff and most of the servers were really friendly too; with the exception of this one kinda short chick with dark brown hair who had a surly attitude. ..Even one of the bar-backs recoiled when he saw how nastily she responded when I simply asked if the glass she was holding was a growler. She looked at me and was like; What? So I repeated the question. Then she said; I don't know; it's a glass; then stormed off. The bar-back and I exchanged glances; like; Damn; you mad bro?..Came back another night and was served by a very pretty; friendly girl with glasses and red lipstick. ..Anyway; overall experience was really good. It's too bad we had already eaten both times before coming here because I would have loved to try the food. Next time :)..P.S. Get a beer flight (or two); you won't regret it.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,XFX4EK7xYjS6W-a0o0zqLg,DygVrfOuPxOZAMqat2xMgQ,5,Fantastic food; great atmosphere; quick service. My biggest criticism is it's a bit crowded; but it's pretty justified; the place was full enough that it warranted the seating; but we still got in and had a seat pretty quickly. The food was top notch. I had bruschetta and chicken. It was awesome. I really enjoyed the atmosphere; it felt amazing; and coming here with good company makes for an awesome night.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,mLEf9N7KTAtAVns5YKFOTw,3nstoxKOmJvyx-fzmTv25g,3,My friend and I came in during lunch time; on Thursday. Keep thought it will be a quick lunch. But I was dead wrong. It was a horrible experience; terrible service. The waiter is in hurry ( I think they need more staff) but it was a Thursday afternoon. So I keep it slide. The foods are average; nothing special. I order a Grilled Chicken and Avocado sandwich. The breads are too dried and over cooked. Chicken was too salty for my taste. .Big disappointment.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,XIAjoHBqlzuVOCPN9IXwIg,SQnx56pMmxOiazeFcaHqZQ,5,Très bon service; surtout avec la serveuse qui s'appelle Anna. Merci mille fois. Bonne bouffe aussi!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,kiZ9wjtgwmNMOLq1I4IuUA,tDkc-300ODLvmRmny1Ln_g,3,This place is great for the atmosphere and location but their food shouldn't be what you come for; nor their beer selection. My husband and I had the wraps and there was much too much sauce to even taste the chicken and veggies in there...maybe that was a good thing? The other couple we were with had the flatbread pizzas which we tried and those too were meh...Service was great; location was prime but other than that not a place I'd ever crave to go to.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,bp5Sw_yB5k9TemD_OhaGHg,UgoC-F2pX4GZyhPIvWgfbQ,5,Endroit très agréable avec une ambiance pub très appréciable !.La meilleure poutine de la ville a mes yeux. Je vous conseille de prendre le supplément avec les frites à la bière; c'est ce qui fait la différence..Je recommande fortement !!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,G_LZkWBCBz5kHblNntDivg,3,Beers are good. Service is ok; but needs to improve. Food is nice; but no cigar. The best thing here are the Tritons and the Smores.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,4IJFCJ1gyEZGZoY00MYXlw,gk-0EoAM1AOZJRzKuxPjrQ,3,The place itself is nice; perfect for a casual lunch or dinner. The food was good as well (fries were phenomenal!)... burger was great; flatbread was a little soggy; salad was nice and light. Overall; average experience. Service was nothing to write home about... waiter hardly ever checked up on us. Would say Les 3 Brasseurs is strictly average.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,17dx_x9W_7QBT-3oiQQEQQ,dm6_wHIXs6BTEiMj7g9Byg,4,There's something about this place I adore...Of note is the flamm- a very flattened pizza.  Anyplace I can get a yummy pizza-like substance along with a pitcher of beer for under $20 is great in my eyes...Also love the beer mugs- I'm not gonna deny sneaking one into my purse many years ago (before I found out I could purchase them)...Guys who work here are easy on the eyes; quick to serve; and make for a generally exciting atmosphere of eating
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,xa4g743VNih9QNKejIe2gw,5WPQnexVof6t71pXrLqqPw,2,Came with a group of friends and the food was fine; but way too pricey for what they offer. The french dip and sausage and sauerkraut are among the better choices; but almost $20 for each dish is too much. I tried the flatbread when I came here ~a year ago and was disappointed with what was mostly plain pizza dough; with a small amount of tasteless stuff on it. Delivery pizza is gourmet in comparison. ..The atmosphere is casual and they have good beer; so I can see this being a place to watch hockey; or a place to go with a large group. But if you're looking for dinner; I recommend you look elsewhere.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,JKkqQWrmrqE_J_NVfDzmHw,xDI72BWd9MArYdXpt_fX3g,2,The food and beer were pretty good; but unfortunately the service overshadowed the meal. We had been traveling all day and wanted a good meal. Before walking in; we wanted to be considerate; so we checked the hours to be sure they weren't closing soon. The posted hours said they closed at midnight. The bartender told us the kitchen was closing at 10:30pm and we needed to order now without giving us time to read the fairly extensive menu. At 11:00 pm; she made last call for beers. At that time; a server spoke to her and said he didn't want to wait around for his last table to finish. She said Tell them we close in 15 minutes. That would have meant they closed at 11:15 rather than the posted midnight. While I can understand staff doesn't want to wait around after closing for stragglers; being rushed put a damper on our meal and gave us an unpleasant first impression of the service in Montréal.  Thankfully; other establishments later showed us what a great city we visited.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,ys2r72zSLb2wqUcXLvN-lw,oCbbloWrC8EhUDr462dkrQ,4,They have their own micro-brewery. The beers are really nice. Had an amber and an ale..The food was great.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,RKL9zjp7xprGHR5ue78xwA,9aGhM27cJCPn5keDk4r-Lw,4,The place is awesome. It's a bit like the st-sulpice; but way classier. When you enter in the store you see all the beer in the giant drums; it's a show stopper; so nice!..They have the perfect thing : a meter of beer. You cannot go there without taking the meter! It's served on a nice wood plate; and you can ask to have many sort of beer; ideal if you want to taste multiple beers. ..The place is well located; and everything seems good. ..I will definitely go again!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,977b5c3I56ZICVniE3BCyA,a058gRSjI7oa0_xBv_fFeQ,4,I went there twice during my stay in Montreal. The one in Vieux Montreal was specially very nice. There's nothing like enjoying your pint of blonde on a late wednesday afternoon looking at the passerby's on the street. The food was good too. The staff was very nice and I'd definitely like to go back there again...Now coming to the main point. The freshly brewed beer was amazing. I am not a huge beer fan; but I had four pints of blonde in my two visits to the restaurant. Now thats something.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,bG_DOb7mltWDfbJS1xmsPQ,4BKbV7AVxKUmB1YWgdluLg,4,A brasserie should be judged atmosphere; menu and beer.  Les 3 Brasseurs delivers on all of those elements; especially the beer...A friend and I had just arrived to town after a long drive from Boston; and needed to find something in a pinch.  It's conveniently located 2 blocks from our hotel; and even on a busy Friday night; we were seated right away...All of the beers we had were not only delicious; but actually impressive.  The food (fish and chips; beef bourguigon) was also quite good. ..The service was prompt and friendly; even for a couple of crass Americans like us...All in all; I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat.  If you're looking for a quick bite; a great beer in a convenient location; you really can't go wrong.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,0rjszWG0f2Ko79v_KNMuhA,4,Food was amazing! My friend came here for her birthday and it was a good atmosphere. I split a duck confiti poutine and French dip sandwich. Both excellent. The group also shared white wine and beer sangria. Mixed reviews from the group; but as I personally dislike the taste of beer; I much preferred the wine one. Service was mediocre; they were very understaffed. It took a long time before our orders were taken and we had to ask twice for our first glasses of water. However; we told the waitress it was our friend's birthday and we were given a small fudge/brownie? No candle because apparently it's a fire hazard. We'd probably return just for the food though!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,9Op4mKjGa0ieDUcNbuvs-Q,0SbFTXMB-VozkBIELqUR3A,3,Decent food. Good beer. Lotsa TV's for sports! Nice bar. Good menu options. I would go there again if i wanted to eat; drink; and watch a game.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,tTA2Tzdu8BdBmgjRgGHvpw,yKnP3Xe2YxgbyzdDer5ibQ,4,I've been to this location once but multiple times at the other location in brossard (Dix30);.the food was in my opinion excellent for what it is; pub fare. ..I like the food and the decor; the service however needs some work. There are not enough servers for the size of the locations; so; you're constantly waiting on things. ..The beer; well; it's meh. There is a reason we don't see it on store shelves; it's a novelty... Nothing more. ..All in all - a great place for a nice quick; casual; meal.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,wzY7hmy0VDqC8Dc8_-5-fA,25nt8REttesVhsfS-qgI0g,4,I came here with friends on week day. The food we ordered was blond beer; burger and calmar frits. The food was awesome. The service is a littl bit slow; but overall; the experience is great.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,avaju7aDyT8sxyQF0rC79w,W3IffxRO-STue1Ewilfjxw,4,Location: On the trendiest street of Montreal; St. Catherine Street. Very easy to spot and great menu selection right outside the door...Service: Our waitress was amazing and quick; very friendly and helped us pick which beers to sample with the traditional sampler (very cool!)...Drinks: After going through the five samples of home-brewed beer (white; light; amber; IPA; brown); we ordered a pint of white; which went perfectly with our meal. We also ordered a traditional sangria; which while delicious; was quite strong. You gotta love wine to have it! Fresh fruit was in the drink...Food: As an appetizer; we ordered traditional BEER-BATTERED poutine. I cannot emphasize enough how delicious the batter on the fries were. The poutine was absolutely fantastic and the best poutine we had throughout our trip to Montreal. For our entree; we ordered burgers which were very thick and overcooked. Would much prefer a thick burger to be medium-rare rather than well done. The side caesar salad that we ordered with it; however; was amazing and was perfectly dressed. For those who are not accustomed to bacon in their caesar salads; be ready for it because Montreal is where you'll get it! (Even at McDonalds) ..Dessert: Our waitress brought us home-baked cookies to end the meal which she made for the customers. She was very nice and realized we were too full to order a full dessert so she gave them to us for free...To summarize: Great beer; great ambiance; overcooked burgers and amazing staff. Recommend!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Z7xuJ9P_rMtBvi4aFmP7zw,rzI1Uqtxj4viu3Synk7hUQ,3,This place transformed into a touristic destination. They have their own microbrewery that's not my favorite. I would suggest the flammkuchen; an alsacien dish; pizza like very thin dough. I used to like going there few years ago; not anymore as service and quality aren't as it used to be.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,FzT-ujff-c11Wa_WdItwig,c6b1PtIf6oKLKYZY82M0gA,3,If you're looking for a sports bar type of feel; this is the place to be!..Especially if there's some sports game on; it'll get loud and crowded so if that's not your cup of tea; maybe check another place out; plus this is a beer place so probably not that great of tea ;)..Liked the decor of the restaurant; very lively and entertaining.  They brew their own beers here; but sad to say; none of which I was a huge fan of.  They do have a popular white beer that has grapefruit in it which wasn't bad if you wanted to try one.  Their IPA is definitely more belgian than IPA; at least to me (I am an IPA girl now thanks to my b/f; sadly I used to love belgians). ..Food was all right; nothing spectacular or mind blowing. They did have this mac n cheese grilled cheese sandwich which was pretty crazy but definitely felt my arteries clogging just looking at it!. .bottom line; if you're looking for a more romantic feel; definitely better place elsewhere but if you wanna just hang out with the guys or watch a game; come on over to Les 3 Brasseurs!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,B5mpfVCviyUl9Bsdef5jUQ,uP51oNFB-GPgyotLl8w4Lg,3,Scouring the Montreal day for the first time; we ventured in here for some food after a long 8 hour drive.  ..I didn't expect this to be a pub; which is basically what it is.  The menu is in French; so I suggest knowing some.  Or do what me and my friends did; and pick things that we thought we knew.  I got the crevette frites because I thought frites meant fries (for an appetizer).  Well that was popcorn shrimp.  Even though it wasn't what I thought it was; it was really good.  I then got the New Orleans pizza; which is a flatbread.  It looked like nachos to me.  I thought it was good when it was hot; but eat it fast; because when it cools off; it isn't that good.  ..They have their own beers; a happy hour from 5-7 on 2 of their beers (the amber and the blond); which is half off.  I wouldn't say to come here; but it's not bad.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,2LptcvhkcFyNXT_NZDPpaQ,dQcBrVbsD01Z9yrYKDPfCA,4,Downtown in Montreal; exhausted; thirsty and hungry? Head to Les Trois Brasseurs...Despite the premium on downtown floor space; this branch has recently expanded even more to hog up almost the entire ground floor of a building. Even at the busiest times; you are guaranteed a short wait; if at all...The music may be a little overwhelming and the menu a little un-navigable; but hang on and you should be impressed...First and foremost; the beers. I think that for such a high-throughput and commercialized establishment (they're a chain; after all) they're awesome. I am a fan of the Brown and Red; but that's just my taste. Given time and a bit of food; I'd have a pitcher to myself gladly...Let's talk food. Their selling point are the Flamms; which I do not find all that special or worth the money. Bruschetta on matzah kinda describes it. It's a pity they put so much focus on them; when they've got some real great dishes on offer...Take the burgers; which are very tasty; or their salads; overflowing in their abundance. The real show-stopper and wallet-saver; however; is the pork shank house specialty...Holy Moses; they must have a pork-friendly cornucopia in the kitchen! The shank is huge; delicious and comes with so many sides you'll struggle to finish them all. Foil-baked potato; sauerkraut; salad and God knows what else...For 12 dollars it's a steal. If that's the House specialty; I commend the house and wish it many fruitful years. Caveat emptor; naturally; as once in a blue moon the shank's porky origin could have been quite fat. ..The homebrew beers make this and all other dishes go down like a charm and I never hesitate going to Trois Brasseurs again and again. ..Yes; the menu is confusing and yes; the variety of foods served can be intimidating. Jut use your common sense and order what a good pub might make in its kitchen; and you will be fine.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,2HXzmRsuudk9k9UMRsILGQ,8ffpNV6iUhoZU61SqHSJLw,3,Food here was really good; had the beef dip; bruschetta w/ mozzarella sticks  and a couple of their blond beers. I think speaking French helps quite a bit in this place! I'd be back next time I'm in Monrrrreal.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,KnKu1SPQTNvaMf9g4D_9Ow,ShqLfsGjuIlhz6SFSDlCDQ,4,Service was great. Chocolate brownies were fantastic. Had poutine here for the first time . The beer was brewed on the premises it was great beer along with a lesson on the ingredients that were used to make the beer.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,ov5NSrwcL4e9qhX9ieI0Bw,84u-GmcU6NlmdW4TKc_HMA,5,I stopped by while wandering around town on a Wednesday at 530. I wanted to watch the hockey game that was going on and I wanted some bar food. I sat at the bar since I was by myself. This was really good. I had the peppy chili flatbread pizza. It mentions that it's hot but I didn't taste any spiceyness (which is good - I didn't want too spicy) I accompanied it with a beer sangria. Also really good. The service was fast and friendly. ..It's not award winning but it is good bar food and that was all I was looking for!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,VUTKNenrXgZit1k_ZVcJQQ,Y0bZPKJVE3Eh0KXf-opSfw,5,My Seafood Linguine and a pitcher of Sangria was delicious!..My friends had the beef de jus (3.5*) and pizza (4*)...Good service!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,mhhxx62w2bISY8_iw3k78g,SQc_i8SOYbQOElEuH_6ZGA,4,We came for the drinks but we stayed for the beef. .This place has literally the best beef I've tasted in a burger and it arrived at my table 8 minutes after I ordered it from our most helpful server; Hannah! Literally; she was phenomenal. .I ordered the 3 Brasseur burger with the maxi fries. My girlfriend ordered the Brie Blue burger. While the flavors on my burger were perfectly balanced; the blue cheese was overpowered by the balsamic reduction on the brie blue burger..As for the drinks; we were less than thrilled with the new editions to the beer cocktails menu made with Les 3 Brasseurs' white and blonde beers brewed on-site. The Moscow mule I ordered was missing the signature sweetness of a ginger beer. The strawberry rhubarb seemed more like a glass of white beer with a slight aftertaste of strawberry. The next time we come for burgers we'll plan to order IPAs..Pro tip: Even if the line looks long; don't worry. On a Saturday night during Nuit Blanche we got a table for 2 in less than five minutes.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,dHUSgYKmfNVURDuokHWQyg,T-Q8DvNdbI0fY0Jm8yau6Q,3,Bon rapport qualité / prix. Digne d'une brasserie de centre ville. Toutefois si vous aimez vraiment les quesadillas si le gout est ok cela est loin du compte pour les amateurs de cuisine espagnole. Ma bavette était très bonne; dommage qu'il ait fallu renvoyer la première servie avant d'avoir la cuisson demandée (bleue). Accueil ok mais serveurs débordés pour être réellement à l'écoute.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,pILwv96yeZsmUjglRsSuDw,9dKv22R0g1AzlyPZVU-QVA,3,Come for the beer; leave before the food comes...I had a hankering for tarte flambé; the Alsatian relative of pizza. I was willing to put my high expectations formed from multiple visits to Strasbourg in check. (You would assume that you could get descent Alsatian food in Francophile Québec...) By any standard; it was awful. Soggy and chewy crust and toppings lost everything in translation.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,RUep7rEnzcFcCA8XobtNSg,LSlU7zDbis8-TnmbMP8S8g,2,Si vous avez soif; si vous souhaitez être servi promptement; alors c'est pas ici que ça se passe!   Cela appris au moins 10 minutes pour prendre notre commande (bières seulement.... la bouffe madame c'est tantôt; m'a t-on dit) 30 minutes plus tard les bières sont arrivées.... et c'est seulement là que nous avons pu commander à manger.... .Les bières étaient bonnes... mais le service pourri!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,gV8FthhicAOTMJnKSV63XQ,eD-L1C4doc4mNjim5Tb4QQ,3,they used to offer free peanuts which was a plus.Now; only the beer is still a reason..good for few friends drinking after work.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,A1KW5YLXdhvLIYDhN76tGw,eAIoPbWgWhSw6YdgIu381Q,2,I'm sure excellent meals have been served here; however; the day that I visited was definitely NOT one of them. My husband and I ordered Poutine as a starter and found it okay. You could definitely tell the fries were of the generic food service variety; and the gravy tasted as if it came straight from the jar. My husband ordered the pork shank and mash and was definitely let down. There was far more inedible fat and connective sinews than actual meat. I ordered the peppy pizza which was okay but wound up picking most of the pepperoni off because it was filled with hard gristle! I really wanted to give them a decent review; and I'm sure that other locations in MTL are decent; however; this one just didn't hit the mark- at all.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,wB8X7GJVQtNQs9ofuG2vlA,HH8Xge9QLibIooiVQ9EQuQ,2,Good beer that they brew on site...but awful food. ..I got the thin crust pizza like dish...it tastes like totinos frozen pizza in the states. Awful...Terrible decision on the first night of the bachelor party. Don't waste your time...this is like a Canadian applebees.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,ROLpP-MhKYwG1qatuzYnMA,XxupTCuPmzc48hjgf4WOGA,2,Usual pub fare..nothing special here. I had the fish and chips and was rather disappointed ;more batter than fish. French fries were no better than the frozen kind that you heat in the oven. My friend had the chicken Caesar salad and she said it was ok ...Won't be bothering to return on next visit to Montreal
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,I92M1nPIuY4KQxCO9NeGwA,Syl3GldNtoP8JKK9kZY7TA,3,Food was delish ; drinks good. But getting our food was to long. Place was clean. With great view.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,xU3sDPonLx1_w4t6wOOpdg,9oYZCGq-A6VgMfqgT98iiQ,5,Service was superb! The food was amazing and the beer was definitely the highlight of the whole experience. The manager was very kind to offer us a serving of the Caesar salad which tasted really good. I got their signature 3 brasseurs burger and the beef patty was juicy with the right amount of tenderness. They also recommended the blonde beer to go with the burger and it truly clicked! Overall; a very satisfying meal in this crazy cold winter.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,pUagQxJZV8MmyS8-wDIMlw,doWNG5JjoskOcZ_MXePvBw,3,A pleasant surprise. Reviews online seemed mixed. The Sainte-Catherine location was only a few blocks from my hotel. As I'm always searching out the local beer; this was the plan for lunch...Bartender was very friendly and helpful; guiding me through the beers. The brown I had was tasty and flavorful -- unlike the beers I had at two other brewpubs...Food was also tasty. I had the smoked meat fllammekeuche (with pickles -- sounds odd; but it works). Sort of a super thin crust pizza. Very tasty and just right for a light lunch. ..Tried to return late in the afternoon the next day; but crowds were out the door. Evidently a local hotspot at prime times.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Wrqn5-gDabA2BJhJy87csg,Q57VkR6SRcxmRHUEoxB0gQ,2,One word: MEDIOCRE.We were 2; waited a long time when they were not busy to be seated; we asked for one of the many empty small booths; and were told that they were only for 3 or 4; meanwhile they soon filled up with only groups of 2..Then our waiter got our order wrong... .The calamari was bad. .And the food was nothing to write home about..Their special beer wasn't even good. .Bottom line: finally tried it and will not go back.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Bc4hV4d7itnxX3DUhNeEsQ,EE2JyObyCyusTzOr3YpRQg,4,En promenade dans Montreal; nous avons trouvé ce bar par hasard..La bière était bonne et les portions de frites très correctes. .Les frites a la bière sont excellentes !
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,kJ4lojFBpi5utB1Djke2WQ,V54sbdxkVgjWJwlKf282VQ,5,Being a regular costumer for few months now; I always feel welcome. Not every Waiter / Waitress is the same; but some are just better. Amazing service at the bar! You have to ask for Iva ! Great variety of drinks; beers are local and they taste great. The food is always served quick and the order is made right. With great ambiance; and welcoming service; a good way to relax after a work day. They made a costumer for months now. I recommend the place.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,bs_FiiqQNyUg6Fh_WqyLyQ,HjZJRksM3tFpx4Reu7Noaw,3,Lively place with a lot of rooms; spills out on the sidewalk.    A nice place to sit after wandering 10 miles through the city on my first trip to Montreal; very much a pub feel with the menu to match.  I had the most egregiously offensive item on the menu: Poutine Flamkucken!    A large thin pizza piled with fries and gravy.   Why not stomach the most touristy pile of calories in the whole place?  The staff seemed very busy but they kept up with the drinks and pace well.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,WTBjrYlY8thkKOCwmFCIhQ,KYZ-WNmdTFNxrxtNFzqgzQ,4,Arrived in Montreal this afternoon; we were starved and looking for somewhere to eat; we choose this place and we were not disappointed the menu as a newspaper was very cute idea;it was a wonderful lunch; we both order the flat bread and it was very good; this was a true flatbread super thin.. It is a large order for one person you will more then likely have left overs; to re-live the lovely lunch again :) ..The service was good and atmospheres was cool and relaxed price was reasonable felt like we got value for our dollar for sure; I hope to have a couple pints before the end of our trip :)
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,wO2sfyalTsCCYJ8AVFP9dw,2,If it comes down to Les 3 Brasseurs or Hurley's; which is right down the street; I'll pick Hurley's every time. This place is very generic and unexciting. The vibe is mediocre at best; the food is ordinary and lacking in flavor and the service is more or less non-existent. Also; somewhat overpriced. Not for me.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,ibP_cryFJJur8xU_p1M57A,1,I got a poutine and the fries were horrible. They were hard and tasted like wet potatoes. The service was very underwhelming...I wouldn't go back.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,dvODnX8jX-5M1ctMiutF7g,p4W_LMdIbgY_6z4GxLL9uw,1,This is my very first 1 star review; but this place deserves it. Service was slow; we couldn't order appetizers because we were told they would take as long to cook as the main course (??); and they took almost 20 minutes to get a waiter to take our order. Other issues were flat soda; no ice; and a lack of butter for bread. ..For making beer on the premises; the amber beer I ordered was; to be frank; not good. For the main course I ordered pork shank; which might as well been called pork fat shank; as there was more of it than the actual meat. Everyone's else's meals were lackluster as well. ..To put it simply; we spoke to a local the next day who said we would have been better off eating at McDonald's. Enough said.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,1G0fw7ywVlg3TS9MIWpyUw,KKH-h7nakIAyL_n72rF0sg,2,Arrived in Montreal today and live visiting here.... Stopped in here as their 'pizzas' looked good. They are pizza like; just on a flatbread. .The staff were friendly but we were unable to sit at a booth as they are for four people which annoyed me a little but guess I can understand they don't want to turn others away. This meant I had to sit at what I would refer to as bar stools and a tiny round table up high. Not a fan of eating like this - no problem if just having a drink! We did end up moving to a smaller booth when one was available. .The food was really nice and we enjoyed the pizza and fries. The food was predictable and tasty. .The service was a little ordinary tonight and we felt a bit under serviced. It took a long time until we could order then once we received our meals no one came near us until we asked for the bill. Not really impressed and would probably not come here again.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,jbjUTojR-GgbJoWMJd4W6w,7-WLl_ye3bZU8D9alk86lg,1,The worst food for the price ever. Mushroom chicken is the worst scallopini I've ever had. The house burger is tasteless;  farmer veggies is really some barely defrosted vegs from the supermarket. Even the fries that come with the burger must have been counted per piece; they didn't even fill the plate. In short; the beer might be ok but do not expect to eat well here.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,eoxGoHtay3VwTpnRepsFzQ,dOt23VCtOGTrdE6E__XbRQ,3,Broad beer selection; mediocre and overpriced food...Good place to try a variety of beers and maybe have an appetizer or lunch. Would not recommend if you're looking for a restaurant for a good night-out meal...Definitely ask about any special beers they may have; as there are some that may not be on the menu. I'd go back for the beer if I was in town again.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,-9b4s874f_CnznTu4JorRg,PhXeoJGUI2MNfD_-vZpEdg,3,I wanted to love this place again because it is where my boyfriend and I first meet but sadly it wasn't great...Les 3 brasseurs is a franchise so I never expect much about the food; i like their onion rings and some of their beers. But the last couple of times I went I was really disappointed. The service is never quite right; all the waitress are nice but clearly have too many clients they can not manage your table properly; we have to wait at least 45 minutes to have water and to order our food; then because of the location the kitchen is also really busy so another 40 min for the food to arrived...The food is not bad if you come for a simple snack; but I really think the burgers use to be good now they are grosse and same for the poutine. The meat is always over cook and there is clearly to much gravy. We took the chance to order the new item; the Poutine flamenkeush (pizza) and that was not great at all; the pizza was super soggy due to the overload of gravy (more gravy than fries) avec the pizza was bland...Overall; not the best 3 brasseurs I went to. Don't even try to have access to the terrasse it would be worst.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,FArIEoSKbCcVqWc2eWNFXA,9pfqqi6BS9XM9NRECkIghQ,4,Les Trois Brasseurs is where I had poutine for the very first time.  It was a medley of flavors on a plate that really shouldn't have gone together so well--French fries; gravy and cheese curds--but came together in perfect harmony.  Mike had promised I'd enjoy it and I did despite my initial skepticism.  Overall; the restaurant is a fairly standard microbrewery with great food and people-watching.  I would definitely be interested in returning.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,xz4EkxvnGig6BJgDgXlzZQ,2,Jeeeeez where to begin..The best part was our waitress she believed in the place and loved her job...3 L blonde beer 23 dollars ...awesome ..Food was terrible I mean terrible fries salad burger everything was just disgusting. The burger tasted off and my friend got sick. Cheese was funky. Calamari was mostly oil and batter no calamari felt like a bucket of grease after eating that...Honestly only reason I came here is because I left the eaton centre and it was raining and we wanted to have dinner and drinks. I would give them 1 star but our poor waitress was so kind and sweet and very professional ANICK was the best part.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Ol7Z6Ak8Y-7vFZsmKiEdRw,HlHu2LQIdJu_jYrpf0NPZA,2,Had an awful lunch in Montreal. It looks like a bar; locate in one of the main shopping street; but food was awful--- it cannot be worse. Limo made was diluted and they charge the price of 2 for a refill. French onion soup was salty; and the smoked salmon tastes not cooked at all. And for that lunch; which got me run to the bathroom on the highway; was priced for 40 dollars. Never; never have it again!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g,ZzU0cZAmZHOmrIdRSOOBOg,2,I've been to 3 Brasseurs all over town a bunch of times even though I find the food and beer just alright. .I probably will be back because I like the atmosphere and service. Even when it's happy hour; waiting times are never too long...The beer itself is good; I like the blonde or the white best- their red has a bitter aftertaste and their stout is just too heavy for me..Their beer cocktails are interesting; you can have them mixed with sprite; grenadine; shot of whisky; lemon liqueur etc. ..Food actually kind of sucks. They rarely ever have specials or change their menu; I find it so bland. Their pizza like dishes are lackluster. They used to have some with chicken as a topping and it was removed from the menu; no clue why as it was the only good one. Crust is too thin; cripsy like a cracker or soft like wet pita depending on the day.....Their burgers are ok; the beer battered one in particular; but fries are frozen and just so flavorless. They serve everything with that mustard/mayo sauce to mask their lack of flavor..They serve beer battered thick cut fries as an appetizer dish; but you cannot ask for it as a side; instead of regular fries;  the waitress told me they are already individually portioned; so frozen; as a basket appetizer and it would be too much with a burger or anything else I was getting...The wraps are a real mess; I've tried their avocado chicken wrap as well as a bbq chicken and it was always steaming hot with a soggy center; mushy pita. Looks like it came straight out of the microwave....Fish and chips another awful mess; fish incredibly oily and soggy...Their chicken brochette dish would be the best I had of the bunch but for 14$ the portion is incredibly small. I always like to replace my fries with a side of rice and unfortunately it looks like they only give you 3 spoonfuls. Once; their green beans were undercooked; hard; to the point of being raw...I don't come here for the food; neither should you; unless you just want a burger or nachos- A couple drinks or place to hang after work is what it's for.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,qF9L6T65pBhtpm1Qmo-uQA,JaFqtUf0Uen5MBxYGQcSLQ,1,American tourist walking around Montreal looking for a place to grab lunch.  Saw a good amount of people inside so thought it would be decent...Talked to the host in english; who sat us at a table; but he gave us menus entirely in French.  Tried to get the attention of 4 different servers for an English version of the menu with no luck.  Took 10+ minutes for server to finally come and ask if we wanted drinks and give us new menus...Waited 20+ minutes for someone to take our order and no one ever came.  We ended up asking for the check and leaving to head somewhere else.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,m7uzBJ0yPXZkKllOEa0yDQ,XI3XY2Sc-V25IA4VuUZGsw,1,Ugh.  Awful.  Awful.  Service - HORRIFIC.  Food - BAD.  Enjoyed every minute of dining & service in Montreal; until tonight.   Average 25% tip.   Gave 15; and they deserved l
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,YZ0PyON8v8PcunoA6H3kBg,clnPUykF8rbci6UfqucsAg,2,First off when we got to the restaurant there was a line and I was 5 seconds from walking out the door; but my hunger got the best of me. Needless to say they were very fast at getting us a table and even faster with delivering the food. The drinks on the other hand; we had to remind the waiter twice to get... As I have to follow a gluten free diet I was shocked to not find a single option I could have.. I had to go with my safe bet and get plain salad and grilled chicken... yum... Great atmosphere but would like more options for dietary restrictions
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,VDmZ5Nv5FeByxtXu9Es5iQ,4,Les 3 Brasseurs is a pleasing​ regional chain of microbreweries in Montréal and ​possibly the only restaurant​ I was able to find that serves Growlers. ..After a brisk walk through the touristic downtown area in Montréal;​ our party was ready for cold libations and Les 3 Brasseurs kind of found us. It is a rather large restaurant​ with a massive horseshoe-shaped​ Bar and surrounding tables that make for great viewing of sporting events and passersby​ alike. the service is solid (contrary to what most of the local Yelpers cite) and the prices are very reasonable considering the locale. That or I just accustomed to what we would pay here in SoCal.....True to form; I elected to try their IPA which is a delightful; full-bodied​ number featuring​ an excess​ of Cascade and Amarillo hops; blended​ with pale malt and crystal malts. This is an unfiltered brew that is profoundly​ fermented. It delivers fragrances​ from fresh hops with hints of citrus and spruce with a bitter and piney close. I was so enamored​ by it I ordered a second and then even purchased a Growler's worth to take back with me to the Hotel room. Yes; it truly is that delicious​. ..I was a party of 4 and everyone seemed to love their choices in Beer as well making a safe bet for microbrew aficionado​s or novices alike. They seemed to have countless options on tap along with a lengthy list of bottled mass produced favorites. ..As my trip progressed I started running into other locations of Les 3 Brasseurs and they quickly became my go-to in the event I wanted a quick pint I knew I could count​ on. They also offer a full kitchen but you will have to look elsewhere for an opinion on that. I didn't get all the way to Montréal for a franchise pub grub experience. Sorry about that.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,d3VsbmMRKSDc3w_O3Mbwog,Xyr176YtO4kAHYkHTYl3UA,3,The beers are excellent. I had the amber beer (much like a belgian ale like Leffe). The food is also great. I've had the smoked salmon flamm with capers and cheese. Most recently I had the alcasienne flam; which; had slices of kielbasa; sauerkraut and gruyere. It was good but I wish it had some sort of sauce since it was a but dry. The poutine; however was awesome!!!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,VagaYH46uI0H460e6c5-oA,CL3N1pbVQoHQ8GKiwnbc0g,4,Stopped by her for drinks randomly while roaming the city. Definitely has brew-house feel to it which is pretty cool. Didn't try much food outside of the nachos; which were ok; but again my tunnel vision was set on the beer. The blonde belgium pale ale was pretty good and extremely . The blonde tasted like a light version of leffe blond. They also had these beer cocktails which were an interesting twisted on a typical brew house like beer & whiskey; beer & grenadine; and some other odd mixtures.Overall the place is pretty good and the servers were really nice  and were pretty attentive.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,St5sFHzOM0ctIU1pfFMh1A,it08WgMrIKH5wHqXgX7WOg,4,It's  a nice place to drink a beer and eat some poutines; perfect to watch sports or hang out with your friends.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,CsyKgh3CHrdvY6Rdx6JGeA,eYCRsQEg4TMH-fFSAQaZuQ,4,I only had the ceasar salad and the wings from the food menu; but neither disappointed. I did try all of the beers; though; and they were quite appeasing. (Minus the IPA; but only because I don't usually prefer IPAs.) And; my favorite of all; was the raspbeery lemonade beer cocktail. What a neat drink; and it actually tasted good; too! ..But the real reason I liked this place so much was the atmosphere. It just felt good to be there.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,iO-5vDAC9-KTC72kgk4arg,5Q1HUrP5ETX5RwIGn2ZKeA,5,Went there two nights in a row. Excellent local IPA and Wit beers. Salads were huge and very good. The cassoulet was superb; great flavor and a generous serving. The Poutine was also very good. Our waitress (both evenings as it turned out); Jen; was excellent with a nice sense of humor. Reasonable prices.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,rvjEv-DiB9fAeW0JUpAbgA,cQURrPSwV9GH3MyhTWrraQ,4,Good food with quick service. Their pizza was good and different. Super thin crust and no tomatoe sauce. Very enjoyable.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,4PGtYE2Uq7S_sjR_2iukbA,Z70dHmYpOKW3T1DJUqT3iQ,3,Good outside atmosphere. Good crisp fish n chips. Provincial Mussels fresh and tasty. Poutine was good. Service friendly but a bit slow. Food was slow coming out from the kitchen. They brought out a nice tray of mussels and then they went by...to another table that was seated after ours.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,Cxiyc3vxg2jBeSVHhFz6Wg,F3dpNfv6myP_tU5jncodtQ,1,First spot we stopped at when we wondered around Montreal. It looked like a cool place when we came in; the decor was okay. There were a lot of people inside. ..The waitress nice at first but she came off rude when we asked questions about the menu. My boyfriend ordered a pizza like dish... NOT pizza; she corrected us for calling it a pizza... It was bland. I ordered the classic burger; more like shit burger. It was like a frozen patty that had been cooked until completely dry! They give you the mayo on the side; good flavor. I ate the fries with ketchup...When we went to pay we paid cash.. I ordered Canadian money from my bank back home.  The girl ran after me on my way out to say the bill was no good. It was just a later year; (date printed)  but I felt so offended that she would come after me to say I gave her counterfeit money!  AND IT WAS A FIVE$ BILL!..If I could give Zero stars I would!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,kdmEklD1_WAPHiv_Tv_XwA,iJjtO1vb30y9frp32q0Awg,3,Our starving yet patient family of four came upon Les 3 Brasseurs after trying to book many other restaurants. Fortunately; we didn't have to wait long to be seated. However the service was quite slow because we had one polite and helpful waitress for about 20 tables.  The bar scene looked fun for 20 somethings; the restaurant was giant; like a fancier version of Chili's.  With more staff and a healthier menu; this could be a fantastic family restuarant for Vieux Montreal. Good fallback for a family.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,7Ri5xkuj6rMvD8F2zjWFow,ohfusvGfIsuV12hJ6M58YA,3,They have great beers; home-brewed with different distinctive tastes depending which variety you choose. They also have happy hours where the blond and amber beer are on special and they often come out with a special variety monthly...The ambience is great; very clean and not too noisy. I love the free peanuts; goes well with the beer when waiting for the food...The food is alright; but the service is just below average. Food comes out pretty slow; and the waitresses rarely come to take away the empty plates or fill my water...However; it is still a great place to go in groups; but I'd recommend you to go for the beer and appetizers only.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,zH6jKkSP1Sy20-gRcmprdw,2slcCWBjRvUmYoXKpIRSUg,1,Wow; in contrast to all the great restaurants and pubs in Montreal; this was the pits.  Service was very efficient; until we finished our meal and our waitress disappeared for the next 20 minutes.  The blonde beer was horrible; almost a sweet and sour taste at the same time.  My wife and I challenged each other to take a swig without wincing and we couldn't pull it off.  I have tried many beers and enjoy microbrews but this was horrible.  Then we noticed a waitress taking the dirty silverware that was collected from the tables; putting them in a pitcher which I assume was slightly soapy water; wiping them off with a towel and putting them back in a tray as clean.  This was not in the kitchen; but on a side table and no rinsing.  The music from the pop videos was so loud; you had to shout to have a conversation; and it was all rap and pop crap.  Overall a really bad experience.  If you want a good pub; try Ye Olde Orchard Pub; great food and service and good selection of beers; both Irish and local.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,ps00_kAh92IMjXqTzxuHrw,PqfsyleZbREo5ykO0Dj20g,3,Les Trois Brasseurs is one of those places I would consider just average.  Nothing really makes you crazy to go back; but nothing is also really stopping you from returning.  ..Their beer selection is all brewed locally and they have a full bar for those looking for something stronger.  ..The food; which two of us ordered burgers and two sandwiches; was pretty good.  The fries were done nicely and the burger was satisfying.  Their signature mayonaisse came in a sealed container like fast food joints sauces which was kind of odd.  ..Prices were decent; especially given it's downtown; St. Catherine location.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,D0E-lGF7zXUJjFJEgUePsQ,ZUsSGd9IeFaXSXFMr1bq4Q,3,We came here cause we were shopping across the street and heard this place brews its own beer. This place feels like your garden variety tavern-themed casual dining place in style with American restaurant chains such as Bennigans or even TGI Friday. It's busy and bustling with Salt & Pepper video playing on big screens. The food are all safe picks of American casual food such as cesar salad; hamburger; pizza (YAWN)....I tried 4 of the beers as they have a little sampler Et Cetera with glasses with 4 oz; white; blonde; amber (rousse) and brown. The blonde and Amber were not bad for a microbrew; although I think I'll stick with Griffon Rousse.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,JMSW2PE8Xl6xZrSsRe4eEw,Q-n_yGEpCThAdksLTV_Nkg,5,This was a great place. The amber beer was awesome. The service was good & the place was clean & it had a good atmosphere.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,0P2tOgdFpCS2Zk_vieLaQg,nd72cvpj2dY6wxE0NyzdIQ,4,Went here on Friday night. fairly busy but we were still able to get seated with a party of 7 pretty quick. I had the 3 Brasseurs sauerkraut and beer sampler. I loved both and thought the prices were very fair here. Ill be coming back here next year for sure.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,S84mUyQA14a4SLv6a8Lzaw,0nXcDV3ZAca3toADH7VZTg,2,Les 3 brasseurs est plus une solution de rechange lorsque tous les autres restos à proximité sont pleins. Chaque fois que j'y vais; je suis déçue de la nourriture. Souvent les plats sont fades; secs; bref n'ont rien d'extraordinaire et absolument tout d'ordinaire. Lorsque j'y suis allée hier; c'était encore pire. Sur 6 personnes; seulement 2 ont apprécié leur nourriture (des flamms....seule bonne option du menu me semble-t-il). Mon wrap aux légumes grillés ne contenaient que 2 ou 3 minuscules morceaux de poivron et où étaient les avocats? Pire sandwich que j'ai pu manger dans ma vie. Je préférerais encore avaler un sandwich de la cafétéria de l'université. Mon amie qui a pris la tartine aux fruits de mer a été atrocement déçue elle aussi... Son plat avait l'air d'une grosse  toast  garnie de câpres; de saumon fumé  cheap  et de 4 ou 5 crevettes surgelées... Pas fameux! Côté bière; tous ont cependant bien aimé. J'avais opté pour la sangria blanche et encore là; j'ai été déçue. Mon verre ressemblait à un mélange fluo de jus en poudre. Disons que ce n'est pas la boisson que j'avais en tête. ..Parlons service maintenant : queeee c'estttt lent! Nous avons dû attendre un bon 20 minutes avant que la serveuse vienne prendre nos commandes de boissons. Puis; un autre 20 minutes pour la nourriture. Ensuite; 25 à 30 minutes pour que la nourriture arrive. Finalement; presque 30 minutes après que nous ayons fini nos plats; nous avons dû aller chercher la serveuse pour qu'elle prenne notre commande de desserts. Beaucoup trop de temps d'attente additionné pour un restaurant aussi...boff. C'était bruyant et la musique était digne d'un club à 2 h du mat'. ..Mes 2 étoiles vont à la serveuse qui; malgré sa lenteur; était gentille et n'hésitait pas à nous recommander des plats (nous aurions peut-être dû l'écouter!).
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,dmx5Aryrq50rZ4Q22DcZ_w,1sn9-dV3wOLb90BcoWMKTw,4,Poutine flatbread; that's all I need to say. Amazing! Also great home brewed beers! The stout was creamy and tasty. A perfect compliment to a flatbread covered with poutine!
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,2oC5q5MJdIXLYtIQEsBnrg,GyMt3jYap29z_mIbfHXXzQ,4,Staff was courteous. Food was okay. Barmaids offered excellent service.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,dm1p28SCGJ0z3cQcpy20GA,yt2i4q0cnoJw5h4K-hVmgw,4,We were visiting Montreal and checked this place out. My wife and son got burgers and they were very happy since the burgers were cooked the way they like them . Often; my wife deals with undercooked burgers at other establishments and has to send them back. I had the chicken bacon poutine; which is a Quebec dish of fries topped with pulled chicken white meat; bacon; cheese chunks and grazy. It was very good and it's too bad one cannot find this in Boston; at least that I know of. I had an IPA and my wife a Belgian wheat ale since the 3 brasseurs is a brewpub. Both beers were good though unexceptional or challenging. I am used to IPA's with more character though perhaps Canadian/Quebecois tastes are different and these beers fit the bill up north. The service was very good; best I have had in a long time; anywhere.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,puMWOwZTa1A2B9oMRFl7KQ,WwUSK9PHYajDqyv3v95jxg,2,Excellent service;  friendly staff.  No Stanley Stout; no beer of the month; mac and cheese was just noodles with cheese (no sauce) and soggy fries.  Shit food and no beer on site that was advertised; pretty lame; last time I hit this location. Your done 3B.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,cQAZN2ZKyMI1GXGm36lDhg,_Y34ZZkB13cr3xd7JJHy7Q,3,The food item that most people come here for is the flamm which according to their menu is not a pizza; however that's simply the easiest way to describe it to someone...Sure it isn't a pizza; but it's pizza like. Flattened dough with ingredients on top. Because of how thin it is; it ends up being extremely crispy which is delicious...This little chain is typical of most micro-brew bar / restaurants. You know; exposed vats; beer steins; barrels; wood and iron. The typical things that would make you think...brewery...It does get pretty packed in here but it is one of the places that the kitchen stays open reasonably late with decent bar food...The Quebecoise flamm is by far one of the most popular from the reaction I got from the server when I ordered it. I can certainly see why; it is a simple combination of some of the tastiest ingredients.  Onions. Bacon and cheese.  All three of which are heavily enjoyed on their own...This is certainly not a destination eatery by any means; but it is a place you can easily kick back at for some beer  and food...Check out the meter stick; which is a meter of beer.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,vJt7yL1btt9VvBzZX8cUhg,0-ZwrtzzPOYUZqyMeLeTsg,4,Really good food and drink. Excellent onion rings and great sun dried tomato and goat cheese pizza
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,qF0zZHtqaMbFF3UePDCaHg,R_xntohqfChcZ9wtDHqe5w,3,While this place was a saviour and a half on a hot day I sadly am giving it a 3/5 and here's why:..The beer. The beer should be the best part; it is after all Les 3 Brasseurs.... The three brewers. I don't love their beer. I was disappointed by the IPA. I expect an IPA to be the right mix of hoppy and malty and this was obviously tamed down... I expect because this is a chain and less about focusing on the beer themselves so to make it appeal to more they dumbed down the hops but it didn't do it for me. ..The atmosphere was good; we sat at the bar which is pretty funky; neat old lights with the brew tanks visible and felt very brew-pubby...The service was okay. Okay at best. It was really busy and people were running around so it's understandable; but it wasn't memorable. ..The location really did save us the most. We'd been wandering Montreal all day with our packs before our train and so this was a great place to stop in as is nice and close to the train but to be honest; that's about it...I expect more in Montreal really. There are so many amazing breweries and brasseries around the city I expected more.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,bxaICaGxzYHSB1MsztlGdg,TP-WhkEQ6PUhWptDf0OG6w,3,If you're looking to drink fresh beers and have no other wants; I guest this place will fulfill all of those goals. Great location. We usually stop by to drink one beer and eat a poutine... Their poutines have crispy fries and the sauce doesn't taste too much the concentrated meat; but rather has a light appearance and taste. I must say; the service is o-kay. They take themselves too seriously; there's no humour (but wait; I haven't rated them on this aspect). Last times we went there they had a hard time delivering what we have requested. We have asked there be no cheese in the salad and they forgot. We requested a vegan meal; they brought a meal made with cheese... Perhaps they should teach their staff what the word 'vegan' means. And they do take a while to serve you. Giving it a three because we definitely have other bars in Montreal that will serve you better.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,o-wACxsV3c9Gdy1A__GOLg,ciyDzcqEQO6OW0Zgy0kk4Q,1,Jesus Christ; I've never had such poor service in my life. I visit 3 brewers very frequently and I don't know what's been happening recently but it's not looking good. Highlights of the night:..1. Our waiter had half our orders completely wrong and questioned us about it...2. When the waiter realized he got the orders wrong he sent the plates back but 2 of us had to wait and let their plates get cold while waiting for the other 2 orders to be remade...3. We ordered coffees and it took forever to come in. We ordered 2 coffees; they only brought one...But we waited so long that I decided to cancel mine...3. The whipped cream on the coffee looked like it had gone bad and it was not good to drink. It was grainy and wouldn't mix with the coffee. We sent that back and asked for coffee without any whipped cream ..4. Not a single apology offered through out the night. We just got our bills and took off. ...If you love 3 brewers just skip this location because it was god damn terrible. Slow; inattentive; careless service to say the least.
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,WCHArapR0ZhduJElR9axjA,Z9s0zjMLbsrSXiLqOypMTA,4,Lol I always come here on weeknights after 11 or 12 if I want to grab a quick drink with friends. Their blonde beer was actually quite good; and this comes from a non beer drinker. Anyways they have a good collection on dark choices for JD remy martins or cognac. The bar upstairs is huge with more rooms for people to sit around in cozy booths. I never really had food here as kitchens always closed by the time arrive; but from what my friends rave its good. Overall a good place to come hit for the location around on weeknights :)
gYAM9MZ_s-YKIUZSZ2Evyg,wj5vlcfBWNIrNqyJKGCU0A,x1bjndiM_j6S6PCY59BilQ,3,Tried La Moulin Rouge and it was okay. The place was a bit too packed and noisy though. We'd probably still go back for the beer.
GZ4UciilQ8pYTC2k7hDxaA,kxA0vTDi1KABuA5Tgg1HKA,5WrHeBI4-AuU1bPaCB19pw,3,Standard museum cafe. Stylish and minimal; and predictably slightly overpriced. However; the wine we had (recommended by the friendly bartenderess) was great.  The cheese plate was pretty generous; and we had a really nice squash soup. ..It's quite an elegant interior; but slap on a sleek black ensemble; and even if casual; you'll be fine. Nice dining experience in a beautiful museum.
GZ4UciilQ8pYTC2k7hDxaA,FNu-N5gs0jBXbPeORI8RlA,xp5Mywl8s1MCXwCXporOOQ,1,We had a very disappointing lunch and certainly; Montreal can do better. .At the height of the tourist season; between the fabulous Pompeii and Lautrec exhibitions; the Cafe should do much more to appeal to and entice visitors to our city; let alone regulars like me. ..The Cafe isn't what it used to be be. No more  onion soup and there were only a few regional or seasonal specialties. The prices were exorbitant considering the offerings...I ordered the soup de jour; a flavourless purée of potato and vegetables. My main dish; an entree of gravlax was mediocre to say the least. 3 slices of toasted ficelle with the proverbial smear of flavoured mayo. Not enough ficelle to match the salmon; I ate the rest with the accompanying dinner roll. At $13 this was not worth the cost. To add insult to injury; my accompanying baby arugula greens were topped with a disgusting piece of mystery object (dried arugula?); something that should not escape a cautious chef's eye...Lunch for 3 without wine; tip or coffee (we all ordered the appetizer plates and there was one other soup) was $83! ..The only positive note was the service of our waitress. She was very attentive and professional. I did; however; note that there was a couple who stood for about 10 minutes before being greeted or seated by the hostess. They weren't happy either...I think that the Cafe has many problems which should be sorted out quickly before it's too late.

However; I definitely don't recommend it during lunch hour. Flood of business man and woman will come flying in. If you go early; you'll be able to catch seniors looking at their daily newspaper. Being a chain place; the coffee is meh; despite of this certainly a place to hit the books or grab a small bite to eat.

Comme ils n'avaient plus de sandwich du jour; que je voulais commander; ils m'ont proposé un autre sandwich de prix équivalent. Un joli geste; qui m'a convaincu de prendre une boisson chaude en plus. J'ai opté pour le matcha latte. Et je ne sais pas s'ils le font toujours comme ca ou si le manager savait que ça irait bien ensemble; mais ils ont rajouté du sirop de framboise : délicieux et très original !.Je ne regrette pas :)..C'est un endroit parfait pour chiller; papoter entre amis ou même venir travailler (il y a des prises et du wifi).Il y a une bonne atmosphère.
I_3cy0TaRDPXq10G5FI3Zw,mnzvRwIiFlDQT_xLrAADeg,sohE71GWwLrnDlpoo63wdA,5,A family owned restaurant; very friendly atmosphere. I didn't know we had such a good restaurant in LaSalle! .Kimchi and Korean carrot salad were delicious. I tried Soon Tofu tonight and it was amazing!

Today; the bean burger I ate was delicious except for an undercooked section that was inedible. However; when cooked right; the burger is delicious! Extra points for the service; and ambiance. Free lemon induced water (something many Montreal places don't offer) was a plus. A little pricer for the quality but not the atmosphere. The smoothie I had was delicious. Visit if your in town and looking for a vegan bite.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,J7Zh0A9UyyHIpxqvpgMe-Q,3,This is meant as 3 1/2 stars.I have been to Copper Branch a few times; different ones. I also have had food delivered by Foodora when we were doing overtime at work. Never been a Fan. It's always been one of those places that I would go to if I just wanted a soup to go with my lunch. .Today we went for lunch as this one has tables outside and it was a nice day. I decided to take their new dish with the zoodles because I wanted something light but didn't want their salads. Honestly; I didn't mind the portion but looking at the picture and knowing this costs $12-$14 tax incl.; you can conclude that it was expensive for what you get..I would come back for the curry soup that they usually have but other than that; it will stay what it's always been for me :)
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,t6EA5Nan-GsiattaFnnv9w,EoOeQ12pGtt1lsBsIiMuqw,5,Love love love this place. Can't even count the number of times we've ordered delivery from copper branch. I'm tried everything from burgers to bowls; shakes and desserts. My favorite has got to be the chicken teriyaki sandwich (made with shiitake mushroom) and their chocolate zucchini brownie . The sandwich is amazing; the texture of shiitake mushroom taste just like; if not better than regular chicken. & the chocolate zucchini brownie; probably the best brownie I've ever had in my life. Its so rich but not overly sweet; and for $4 a piece; please just go try it. .  The prices are also very reasonable; the sandwiches burgers are around $8-$10 while bowls are $11-$14 (also comes in mini).
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,WtmmtVkui7AjVIZvnqQHwg,xilOqUi8_g9A3mLASLICSQ,4,TLDR: Quick; affordable; yummy vegan food...I first went to Copper Branch after I heard of their vegan poutine and I had to try it. It was definitely on par with the animal-based poutines; but with less guilt accompanying it. I might even dare say that it was better than most of the animal-based poutines I've had. I've frequented their other locations and tried their other menu items which were also delicious. Service is always executed efficiently and with a smile. Copper Branch is my go to place when I've forgotten my lunch at home so that I can still have a healthy; tasty; and filling meal.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,GGI39_EL1ERSqyWX1tEjMA,s1_PqbjQIqN1GYqhLTOawQ,4,I love the vegan and well-seasoned food. So whether it is their sliders or bowls or even fries; everything is just so perfect..Their coconut milk hot chocolate is really different and I loved it. The portions are decent; but for bowls and soups; they are generous..The baked fries are little less sinful and so crisp; you can't just avoid them. Black bean burger is one of my regular favourites; along with zucchini brownie and Buddha bowl...whether you are vegetarian or not; this place deserves a shot!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,VoaNRP3SDkwUFj_N4ALdqA,QB3RKHq3PRq2B4EYr7Twhg,5,One of my favourite copper branch locations! The staff is so friendly; and very fast compared to some of the other locations (west island/Dix30). I have yet to taste anything on the menu I didn't like. I highly recommend the scrambled tofu sandwich for breakfast; and the shiitake sandwich for lunch. Is it pricey? Yes; but worth it as far as I'm concerned. You pay for what you get; everything tastes very fresh and so amazing!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,A7YlcidsiAZzU-tCSsrTSg,tdeNVr7yky0pFRn407GiLg,5,I actually discovered Copper Branch when I was at a conference and their company did some catering. I've seen their franchise all over downtown but I was hesitant and wrote it off as another wannabe healthy fast food place...and boy; was I wrong!..Good: at $8.49 for a mini bowl (which is pretty generous); you get a hearty mix of vegetables and protein option. I always get the Aztec bowl with shiitake teriyaki (it's a mock chicken with mushroom base). One of the most satisfying fast healthy food places you'll ever eat at; without feeling bloated or guilty. The staff is also very friendly at this particular location and I purposely come to the Bishop location even if there's another one closer to me. Great job with the customer service!..Bad: my boyfriend tried to order a burger but swapped the buns for a wrap (which later we found out was an extra $1.50 charge) and it looked like the most pathetic and unappetizing wrap I've ever seen. It looked like a 4 year old rolled it up. Granted; it still tasted pretty good; but it was really small and barely filling (for the same price as a bowl). The whole time I was eating my food; I was roasting my boyfriend  and his sad wrap. Moral of the story is; don't get their poorly made wraps if aesthetics matter to you...Bottom line: out with Aux Vivres; this is my new favourite vegetarian spot!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,kgSpdl_xsqYNwWea0JpYHw,jxmeUqGXe5x1xj_bg5Pzlg,5,So its my first night in Montreal; and I'm sad to say that I couldn't get myself to leave my warm hotel room after a long day out in the cold. This Miami girl was having none of the struggle of putting on 6 layers of cold. Long story short- take out time...I ordered from this restaurant because I read good reviews about it; and the food was so good! Personally I enjoy a good amount of veggie meat to vegetables portions so I loved each meal! We kind of picked a variety of things off the menu so when I got the food I just guessed what I was eating. But you can't go wrong- everything was so tasty!..They delivered the food 20 minutes earlier then we expected; and straight to the room! Also keep in mind that the servings are a bit small so order accordingly.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,sSY8HvYNFICXb9fdDLC7jA,2jYR6ToFJNQJPj2HDds0aA,5,Absolutely loved their food; their friendly staff and the Coldplay music was def a plus
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,oIgnbSgc6YpYjM3dZKH0Ww,fGvt_CNog_yKlaJxI0WCMA,3,J'aimerais bien donner un 5 étoiles car la nourriture est excellente et j'adore encourager un resto qui ne fait pas de mal aux animaux mais; même sir la rue Mt-Royal les employés parlent anglais; l'assiette brunch du matin est petite et le café dans un verre de carton.....
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,E9-DCTW1a4Cl0MfGfocq4w,6HIRnpo8QLzX6k47S3ljKw,3,After comming in an announcing to her I have never been here before and am just looking for a quick bite and a coffee ; she gives me the menu.  There was nothing that I wanted so I just got a coffee 4 bucks for 16oz .... I go to put in cream and sugar only to find out they don't have any ... So I ask and she says they are vegan. I said well I don't want a coffee with no cream or sugar ; and she says well it's posted outside we are vegan. I said ok well you know I've never been here before and you should've told me before you gave me the coffee and I paid that there was no cream. ..She wouldn't refund me and just kept saying they are vegan. ...*update* customer service reached out to me ; and rectified the situation. I'm gonna say whoever I dealt with was probably just having a shit day.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,b7kWP5vOctTGtTaqbpUemA,pYG8HKyTP9mdKPnKC_KL4Q,5,Copper branch is a great spot to get very healthy vegan food when you are in a hurry. I really adore their galaxy burger....nom! I also like thier bowls because there is usually a generous amount of veggies. I also recommend you grab the Gandhi smoothie if you go. More like Sooooothie because of the refreshing ginger which really refreshes you.  Read more about them on my blog: http://mtlveg.com/2016/05/25/montreal-vegan-restaurant-copper-branch/
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,XdXl8P9gfrpT3Q-E4Raiig,8pt2Ep7FgCse_Rvbrv794g,4,Pleasantly surprised by this place. Felt like a chain but they have some amazing vegan food. The 2 burgers are a must have. The vegan waffles were a little dry but the sauce and fruit preserves we're excellent. Fries werent as crispy as I would have imagined but overall a must try restaurant..Street parking only but fairly close to Guy Concordia metro
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,0BniaSbVER2kpxK1LBUknw,c3yEz56DdE6dQygSUR_rVA,4,The vegan poutine was OK; I wish the cheese actually melted. The power bowls (breakfast and lunch) are good. Just know that they are a bit slow with making the food.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,ZAWkgziqkWs29WhJ7HiRgw,vTtR_T-nPbVWCy-0bLMcgg,1,The food is good;  but more importantly (for me) it's very slow.  For a place where a good part of the clientele want take out; they're not up to it... Still waiting after 20 minutes with 5 people in here... And I just realized they didn't add the cheese I paid for on the shiitake sandwich.  Customer lost.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,DyKN93B13S4I2As2CdS2RA,3MReed_ZOVCT9j_X--Fyqw,4,Awesome place with some unique vegan menu offerings. I tried copper burger and shiitake teriyaki burger. Both were good but on the sweeter side. If you like spicy or salty; avoid these two. They are definitely very sweet. The poutine was good but felt a little too salty. I took out one star for a long wait - about 20 minutes to get our food. But I guess it is the price to pay for freshness. Also; portions felt on the smaller side. But again this may be me being used to American sized portions where a burger is larger than one's head.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,fi38ETFUNBBndrkKqLqUtA,-kGUIyyS8gzWrrYBiKbZCw,4,Copper Branch offers a fast food formula for vegans on the go; akin to other bigger chains like Subway; with a focus on healthy foods. ..The service is quick and the staff is polite. The location is strategic; right in the heart of downtown Montreal; and the interior design is fresh; minimalist and hipster with a touch of deliberate vintage...During our visit; I had a sweet potato black bean burger; and my husband ordered the copper burger. Both tasted good; but if I may offer a critique; I would say the burgers would have benefited from some type of sauce or spices to enhance the taste. Prices were okay; right on the border of I'm not sure if I should be paying this much for a burger... and yet I just did...Overall; I would still recommend Copper Branch; it might be fast food; but it's vegan; it's healthy and the taste is decent. And for that; in my book it deserves four stars. Although I am not in a rush to go back; I would certainly consider it if I were downtown and needed some quick fuel.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,LXAmXKdSIDJibq_YejMM4w,plo23FzkFPhYC_UL68b6Qw,5,Pleaseeeee bring this to the US! Vegan fast(-ish) food at decent prices is the dream I never knew I had. We tried one of the bowls; the vegan chili; and vegan nachos. Everything was well seasoned and filling and fresh.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,SgoQg5EPIAy_kMJZmJgLsA,BjPtg-PlowRtKKfevyVSGg,3,Forever three stars:..It's like I went to McDonalds but its shareholders converted to veganism and health foods. ..It's all reheated stuff from the freezer but it's good reheated stuff from the freezer...The beverages look fanciful and trendy. The tea was okay...If I was hungry for fast; healthy; light and semi-cheapish food for its category; this would be my top option...Just don't forget this is a healthy fast food joint and not a true restaurant and you will be fine.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,WJasY8VhNbIuPXQ6eWsWoA,ySlUXu9MY3FTbeRiA4TfSg,5,Obsessed with the shiitake teriyaki and cole slaw. So delicious! Wish I could eat here every day; and certainly would if I lived in Montreal. The only thing I've had that I didn't care for was the tempeh; which doesn't have much flavor; but the Copper bowl (sub kale for rice); fruit smoothies; and the avocado toast (ask for some dressing) are all delicious!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,5wZ4FZqLigwhSTGuEspefw,y5iF5ZuLxsWwDam5kGWwzQ,5,I love this place. Vegan and gluten free; and they offer so many options! I had the Fusion Asiatique (Asian Fusion) bowl and it was really tasty! I had some trouble ordering because their digital menu is in French and I speak no French; but the staff was very nice and patient and helped with explaining each item. I agree with Jenn A; please come to NYC; I'd be a regular!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,PWQKM6hyIvW3Hh5z8fssRQ,VZsG1WaKbG6UvtGS7vwIcQ,5,Great food; great concept; great service! I'm a fan of copper branch and have been for awhile; just wanted to recognize the great service I had at Copper Branch on Bishop. I was greeted quickly and one of the employees; I think her name was Emma; answered all of my tedious questions about the menu with pleasure.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,LHlKkrkppF-HIV3MOqAKcQ,Rr7tGQ_j_PVnPyibJ5bbHg,1,Ok; I can't believe this place has any good (or even average) reviews. My friend and I (both vegan) went here for dinner one night when we found ourselves downtown and extremely hungry. The place feels like any other fast food restaurant (order at the counter; carry your own tray to your table); which is fine; but good to know before going. We were excited to try everything and so ordered a bunch of food; but unfortunately all of it ranged from disappointing to disgusting...The Aztec bowl was sad. It was just a bunch of ingredients thrown together without any effort to make the flavours combine. It was dry; under-spiced; and mostly tasteless. The sweet potato & black bean burger was worse. Similarly dry; under-spiced; and tasteless; but it also seemed like everything had been store-bought and then frozen for ages. Easily the worst veggie burger I've ever had. The (small) poutine with portobello miso sauce sounded amazing but was inedible. The fries were soggy; there was so much gravy it seemed more like a soup than a poutine; the daiya cheese wasn't even melted; and the whole thing was COLD. Oh yeah; and everything was overpriced - it came out to about $30 for the three items; before tip...This place was so shockingly bad that my friend and I talked about it for a while afterward. I can't believe they opened two locations at once. Seems like it's being run by business people who have absolutley no idea how to make food. Even though there aren't many vegan restaurants in Montreal; you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,U3JJ1L_joaNkoG-_x42AUA,lQRchZ5tBXpsDJMmdtEvwA,4,I love the spicy sweet potato burger here. I also tried the chocolate waffle; which is nicely done with berry compote. The b other tastes so much like a meat burger. ..I love the concept of this place and the mission of living life to the fullest.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,cKm-kSEvPro2qR7SauPR5Q,GtnXBo_uDuavG_OpYZym2g,1,Terrible service. There were only two rather clueless employees working; who couldn't keep up with any of the orders. A long line of clientele formed; and no one was served before twenty minutes of waiting. Get it together!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,lvpmZqGKL8FWLf-Y8JJPLw,y2UbT0HsyQJ2IKNojAt9Jw,5,Quinoa bowls - perfect pre-race fuel for Montreal Dragon Boat Challenge!  Not only really good food; but Daniel!  Best; most charming; most helpful counter person ever!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,Henrt3UXBgJAMaM_9szKiA,fJISwssj_NgwOMzJbMRa-w,4,Vegan fast food? Apparently it's a thing now and Copper Branch has made some vegetarians very happy. Gone are the days of sacrificing a healthy meal for a quick lunch. They do have other locations downtown; however; this one is a personal favourite. The staff are always nothing but friendly and you'll always have an enjoyable experience. I've come multiple times and have on occasion ordered one of their bowls or soups. Those were good but quite average; in my opinion. However; my go-to order is the shiitake teriyaki mushroom burger (!!). Go the extra mile and replace the bun with a collard green wrap. If you'd like to indulge you can try one of their desserts; both are excellent! Copper Branch always uses fresh; high quality ingredients. I've never been disappointed and that mild sense of accomplishment you get from eating a healthy meal is unbeatable.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,OtmF6DLMToJ7cniDjU23Jw,Kzk1QZKK_IIo3wQaJ1czWQ,5,Amazing vegan vegetarian cuisine...delicious; fresh and healthy...what more can one ask for. We had the sweet potatoe and beet burger and the chicken sandwich with baked fries and everything was amazing
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,wxRVZowoEoy7kscvU-FX-w,vlQxQZ3EwI-vPs6IcfiOng,3,Super friendly; helpful staff. I had the poutine and my friend got the Aristotle bowl. Food was tasty; but I think I would be kidding myself if I thought this place was low-cal/low-fat/healthy. Sure; it's healthier because at least you get a lot more veggies than you would typically get in a meal; but there is an abundance of oil in the bowl and I really don't see how the poutine fries are baked and not deep-fried! (Still felt fairly heavy). It's a good option if you really want vegan and you're downtown; but it feels like a poor imitation of Aux Vivres -- and it's not nearly as charming or vibrant.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,hOanhLERJDJoiO39c4tPKg,eDoRfK3QNvnNtOpKjZbcIQ,4,Would love if a location opens in NYC!  This is great vegetarian; vegan; gluten-free fast-food joint.  I wrote fast in quotes because I waited a solid 15 (maybe even 20) minutes for my burger and carrot keftedes to be ready.  But it was totally worth it.  I certainly appreciate being able to choose almost anything on the menu; considering that my lifestyle is based on an anti-inflammatory diet...Best way to describe this place is that's it's a funner; more grown-up; and open-minded version of By Chloe's in NYC.  Ya know - that girl cousin you had who was 2-3 grades older than you; and she seemed way cooler because she was able to tease her hair; wear makeup; get trendy clothes; while you were still wearing the white reeboks and Alexander's jeans.  By this reasoning Copper Branch is the cool older cousin because it has way more offerings that are all incredibly creative and thinking outside-the-box.  The burger was so good; as was the sauce.  Loved the carrot keftedes!  ..If they don't come to NYC before I get back to Montreal; I'll definitely pay them another visit while I'm there.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,pbVlZx4QaRBLRat4x_uI-w,2gs3NGysAqO41UNP8QzOUA,4,i ordered the scrambled tofu sandwich southwest style which was not spicy enough for me. i love the wooden panel walls in the restaurant. the bun was rosemary herb which i thought was delicious.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,hSvOtGdEW8e3lC_YIp-LcQ,-Dog3WEoA_6z9ZJhCE5mFA,4,Mushroom poutine was great. Breakfast tofu sandwich a little bland. Would def go back
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,loojrnv4SmwhQsO01k7maA,rKHmjVWcHI2yyLR4hhscmw,5,My husband and I came here on our way back to the states for a filling yummy meal and we were not disappointed! I had the Aristotle with carrot keftedes (like spicy carrot fastballs; so good!) and my  husband had the bean and sweet potato burger; then we split a poutine. The gravy on the poutine was peppery and savory; really good; doesn't even need the dairy free cheese! Service was fast and helpful; and the food was fresh and generous. So happy to see another vegan option in this forward thinking city!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,-XX8-dQv8g3di1aG2g1rAQ,-Cdun9Zdu-JSWYNwNxTxyg,4,A quick-serve vegan chain restaurant in Canada that I never knew existed till I visited Montreal !! Holy smokes I wish we had this in the United States. I'd be there like three times a week probably.. or more. I really like the the connivence factor of this place. My instant vibe was; oh it's like a fast food situation. Then I thought about it more and realized that it's super similar to the concept of Panera Bread. Like a vegan Panera Bread. That's cool tho; I'm into it...I visited two different Copper Branches during my mini weekend getaway in Montreal. Both times I had a great experience; not over the top or really wowed; just great average expierence...The first one I stopped at I ordered one of the power bowls; The employee recommend quinoa instead of the rice - so I tried it. And it was amazing. He also recommend the shiitake teriyaki for the protein option - so I tried that too. Another amazing recommendation. The bowl I ordered was called Aristotle and it was filled with all sorts of veggies. My favorite was the spinach hummus. It has sweet potato in it too; but it wasn't cooked thru all the way so it was a little stiff and hard to eat. I will say tho; the amount of food you get is more than enough for two meals. And for about $15 CA dollars I'd say that's a good deal-io...The next time I visited; I ordered their chicken wings with aioli sauce and grabbed one of their chia pudding desserts. The wings were so unique I can't even explain it. They used some kind wheat gluten or maybe even soy to give the wings the perfect texture. I loved that they were on a stick too. I wasn't expecting that; but it made it easy to hold and almost fooled me for a chicken wing bone; haha. The wings had just the right amount of heat with the hot sauce and I think the aioli dipping sauce was my favorite of all time. It also came with Sriracha coleslaw that had the perfect chilled balance to chomp on between the warm wings. The chia pudding was decent. I personally would have like it to be a little bit sweeter; but it was still decent. I don't think I'd purchase it again because it just wasn't my kinda dessert; but I'd for sure try the key lime cheezecake next time or the brownie. ..Next time I visit Toronto or Montreal; I'm going to try one of the soups; one of the other power bowls; some more wings; a smoothie and maybe one of the burgers. Then; I'll be in one happy food coma for the rest of the day. ..ps - the menus in store are written in French in Montreal. (not sure about Toronto; I assume the Toronto menus would be in english? No?) BUT; you can pull up an english menu online or  just ask the staff questions. All the staff members I interacted with were super pleasant and helpful.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,GQGLaaffQL7fmqFnZe_GQA,YMcnjS5msGh_l_3jgyX1Wg,5,Great food and the staff was so lovely; much more than at the green panther and other vegan places I've tried! Aztec bowl super delicious!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,yaWnpONXlvdXbi36aKcznw,aZZnBN6WAsx64AfzAnI7xw,3,Travelling always puts a strain on your diet; so it's always nice to come across a healthier vegetarian restaurant on my trips to offset the daily diet of not-so-healthy fat-laden restaurant food..I was here on a Sunday morning for breakfast which the only people other than myself there was a family; and there was only one staff member working there which made for a somewhat slow service. This was fine as they have free WiFi (the password is on your receipt) which gave me some time to catch up on my emails. This is a fast casual restaurant; which means you order and pay at the counter first and someone will call you to pick up your meal; so service was just average and the person working there seemed very disinterested...The self-serve water tasted extremely off-putting; which had a weird bitter and plastic-y taste to it which I am not sure if it's from the overdue slices of limes in the water jug or from the plastic cup. It almost ruined my appetite which made me feel more impatient on my food as I couldn't get the awful taste out of my mouth...I had the smoothie bowl; which was really nice concept and tasted really nice and tasted fresh though the fruits were made from frozen. The homemade granola was also very good and provided well needed texture and substance to this cold soup-like meal. I could have wished the portion was a bit larger or had more granola as it wasn't a very hearty breakfast. I had a cup of the organic orange juice which didn't taste fresh and was a bit on the sour side -- it reminded me of canned Dole orange juice I had when I was a kid which is not a good thing. My coffee with coconut milk was good though.  ..Avoid sitting near the window as it was extremely cold -- I don't know if it's because of the drafty windows or because their ventilation system was blowing cold air during a cold winter spell..I was initially excited about going to this restaurant but with met with overwhelming disappointment.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,gHwLywfCT-lTIMdPPv1jkQ,6kmkmIgB5_CU-skB3vkHjQ,1,This was a terrible experience. ..They microwave everything. The fries? It was literally a box of mushy potato slices stuck together that had been microwaved and covered in pepper. Who told these people to microwave FRIES??? Oh and there was a giant hair inside it. Disgusting. See the pictures for proof. ..The galaxy burger wasen't good either - again it was just microwaved and hot to hold. ..The service was not good. Everyone was confused and looked like they had no idea what they were doing. Very poorly trained staff and poorly thought out workflow. ..Don't bother with this place.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,kXTOG0w-xyDv9or11HO-CQ,v0jJZz0mxWgUZr8R4npktg,5,I love copper branch; every one of Thier meals leaves you satisfied without you feeling sluggish after. Perfect place to grab a bite if your trying to be healthy but in a rush. Or even if you'd like to sit down and enjoy; the atmosphere is chill; and there is so much variety! Not to mention they are environmentally conscious!!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,mW-GEavECfVezN8qXnQSZg,MdRWp9uNWiLOr7i67dlvRg,5,Awesome food! Quality is a must and they know how to serve deliciousness combination its a great vegan restaurant I love the flavor and after going 5 times i'm always satisfied so I will be investing my money again because I love places like that that care about health and cruelty free meal!so far I had the cooper branch burger awesome and the energized bowl are devine my favorite is the medditeraneo
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,nptaypYVM2RVTgm0uuCzeA,PVCkwUNmbgzvCw4ddviPKA,4,As a former Vegan; I appreciate the hard work it takes into making a vegan restaurant with a variety of foods. Although some of the dishes were bland; a lot of what Copper Branch offered to me was delicious; especially the falafel. Their iced tea that comes with the combination menu is also phenomenal. This place is what you make of it; if you are an avid meat eater don't expect satisfaction with their Vege-burgers but with an open mind and pallet this place won't leave you disappointed. Great service as well and very helpful in recommending what combinations to get.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,MeJJ50cVS-ycShR5wBKtHg,LImWpk0nhakbqPA0pwLCow,2,Ordered from ALaCarte and included tip in the payment and then when the guy came we had to pay tip on the card machine so we ended up double tipping and paying $30 for two so-so burgers...I would've been okay if it at least came with fries or a salad or a drink but nope. Just two small burgers that we're way over on the dry side...I've definitely had better $15 burgers.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,aPTxdV3iOlOPs9usJ1yE_w,7chki47oVF_B_nilWWSu9g,4,As a strict vegetarian who enjoys seasoned; tasty food (for some reason; a lot of vegan restaurants seem to think they can forego flavour?) Copper Branch is a real godsend! It's so exciting to see a chain-like vegan company expanding all over the city while offering a delicious alternative to other big box fast food restaurants...My most recent meal from Copper Branch was the tofu and grilled vegetable sandwich with a side vegan brownie. I got it delivered to my apartment and was a bit nervous as I made a note to include no eggplant or tomato (food intolerance problems) and requested it to be replaced with other vegetables. To my surprise and delight; they pulled through without a hitch!..This flavour-packed sandwich was plenty with grilled zucchini; sweet potato; onions and a melty swiss-style vegan cheese. Yum! I shared half with my omnivore boyfriend - who is always skeptical of new vegan places - and I kid you not; he immediately blurted out; Wow! Ok! I LOVE Copper Branch...Oh yeah. Don't even get me started on the brownie. This zucchini-based piece of heaven is just as sweet and satisfying as its traditional counterpart but it's completely vegan friendly and relatively healthy in comparison to your average brownie...The only downside is that it's quite expensive for what you get. This is very common among vegan restaurants though - so don't let it deter you from trying it out! Your stomach will thank you!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,wYapPVIsvVsdzPv93rKchg,4,I wanted to try this place for a very long time. Well; I finally got the chance today and I was not disappointed at all. Everything there is vegan and it tastes oh so good! ..I got the regular lentille soup with the chocolate zuchini brownie. The server asked if I wanted it warm and obviously; I said yes. The soup has this consistent taste and the brownie is... AMAZING. It has enough flavors in the brownie without it being too sweet. The regular soup is big enough for a meal and the brownie is enough to share with two people. ..Needless to say; I got a -10.28$ on my wallet and -1.00 for the great service. The quality of the food did not disappointed me; neither is the portion size. I did expect to get small portions since healthy food is usually expensive but this place is generous. The money spent was worth it!
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,i18oz-2TnGrOJewfisie4g,WgOBsY0a4-UdbG_mgKgdrg,3,Good but not out of this world. A bit expensive for the quantity; and for what is basically juste vegetables..Really quick service.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,qS7mSIiKmQaN6UTbDAI5_w,MyZvBQSImDxVWLiDW4Htwg,4,We got the Bombay Soup; which was nothing but the Indian Daal Tadka and the Aristotle bowl. The Daal was okay but the bowl had refreshing flavours. The price was above average; but in line with other vegan restaurants in the area.
i5XqKrdEFHvJpqAw3YKrag,b-tE42VVC66FIF35EDyisQ,0DSp_9C8zhuNgW1zM7yfvA,3,I enjoyed my meal; but I found that the advertisement was misleading; showing ads that state that for $1.50 the meal could become a trio... It took us forever to understand the employee's explanations; which were confusing. Instead the bill came up to almost $20; which is no problem; but the advertising shouldn't be so misleading.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,Wj5lz_808Nzfu1X5eUn5MA,Ly0l_eh9VRQfYIcav4BaCQ,5,Had lunch here Monday;beer selection was awesome;actually found some excellent ones at very reasonable prices.Had the wings as an appetizer then the steak and frites for my meal...wings were good;though I've had better;have to give 5 stars to the steak and frites..steak was very flavorful and cooked as ordered....Only negative was the bartender;although very polite;was a little slow on our drink orders...I'll definitely go there again.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,MZyMY-nW2ChwIs7ZhELOTQ,JT9lbNaRIeMonyM3AcL_zw,4,This is at least my 5th or 6th visit this week being back in town. Service is still great; our bartender/waitress was very friendly and helpful. Food wise maybe it was an off night but it seemed to have slipped a bit. The candied bacon poutine just wasn't as warm or as tasty as when we'd had it before. The flank steak I ordered was only ok; and kinda tough and chewy even for being med rare. The core beer selection is mostly the same but there are some newer things on it I got to try and those were all pretty awesome. Will definitely keep coming back as long as the food holds up; and even then I'd still come for the beers.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,VzLerz-0Ba3-G_qw3zCiYA,g31zpKUTJyib_5AWqgxZhw,3,Great selection of beers. A lot of variety. Very organized menu. Situated centrally. An easy walk from the metro station and my hotel. Lots of seating space and TVs. Service could've been a bit better. Very touristy. The food was not bad. We enjoyed our calamari. Overall; we didn't have any complaints about the food. Ambiance was a bit loud for me. It you like beer; this is the place for you.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,FdMNvBDX--D_MWuu5qKWDw,7ERnF9RZSscM3vasXHTlPg,3,Je dirais que c'était correct. Le service était bon; surtout que nous étions un gros groupe et le décor chaleureux; mais la nourriture n'était juste pas géniale. J'ai choisi le tartare de boeuf; que j'ai malheureusement trouvé sans goût. Les huitres à 1$; bien que c'est le fun; et la mignonette était bonne; n'étaient pas bien présentés; donc déchirées et la plupart sans leur première eau. ..Je n'hésiterais quand même pas à revenir; en gang; car le choix de bières est très bien et les prix raisonnables!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,gtkzG1oNUutUrDr-3Zvy8g,lTDqIdCdDS3kttA9KBPK5Q,4,We enjoyed but enough dings that it probably ended up a bit pricey for the overall meal...What we had: Brie and cider fondue starter; Veal schnitzel; bacon and bier mussels; and a mushroom side. Plus a couple of nice dark beers...The beer selection is great and there was nothing wrong with the meal as a whole that was a real turnoff. But the bread wasn't crusty. Many of the mussels were a bit small. The frites weren't super-hot and crispy. Nothing was bad but it just wasn't top flight. Maybe being a bit generous but we enjoyed.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,TOtPdelxSLuMUdIiLgtp4Q,NoLrTVqG7t04ukuNY5a_oA,4,Food was excellent but service was very slow at first. I have to give kudos to the very attentive manager for noticing (on his own) that there was a problem. He quickly stepped in and remedied the situation and doted on us the rest of the time.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,sKVpHfhkG_Nvgf_Vfb91Cg,M2wN4ayV4yAXK_NtYcfSzw,5,Came on a game night; you can literally stumble out of here and fall into the Centre Bell. They have over 150 beers to choose from and the staff totally knows their stuff. The food was great (red curry mussels; YUM!) and the entire menu comes with beer recommendations for every option. The fact that we were able to get a table for 4 on a Saturday game night was astounding and better yet; we were met with zero attitude from the hostess which I was expecting and were told that they actually had 3 floors to accommodate people. I will definitely be back here as there is literally something for everyone; the food was tasty and the portions were ample. Loved the brick decor and all of the red: great space with a private room should you want to hold an event here as well.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,sLhx_e9CveYKWQXUzUeCfg,Nv7G166hCEOLiZNnfMfAIA,4,Been here several times over the years and it's been consistently good. Great bar staff. Wonderful selections and more than willing to give you a sample of the many beers they have on tap. The flights are good. The traditional burger is terrible. Upgraded to the Kobe which was remarkably better. Flat screens at the bar to catch the game. Will be back!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,lsV0a661WYsOuHzbuwKmbQ,fZ5aztr_PTZB1tld6tyF9g,4,Decent place to eat for the cost. I ordered two starters as my meal; along with a pint of cider; and with tax and tip was $30; very reasonable. ..I have to be critical; their appetizer pretzels are awesome however the mustard served with them was full of horseradish or something; and it was FAR too hot for me. However; one of the people I was eating with loved it; so that's more personal taste than anything. I did have a pretty bad experience when dipping my pretzel for the first time as there was no warning on the menu or from the server as to how hot this stuff is. ..I also ordered an appetizer sized candied bacon poutine which was plenty large enough for my meal. Fries were nice and all the toppings went well together. ..I would visit again.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,FzziaaloswaPjrBbKGrI0w,yS8l73Sb57Qr2Y0K-Rw3og,3,The two beers I tried were spot on! The crab dip was yummy and exactly what was described. But I am a single female and I sat at the bar. I felt ignored by my server. When I left the tip she asked me if everything was ok. I said no and that I felt ignored. She said she was sorry that I felt that way. I understand she was busy. But she was conversing with other people at the bar but not me. Also she presented the pay machine without asking me anything else. It was only after seeing the 10% tip that she asked or ever looked at me. I should note that going into a sports bar as a single female can be intimidating and I may be being overly critical for a server that is not used to patrons such as myself.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,BylT38W-w-VpXZbR-IZQqg,4-Ie_SwB39yO548YZnBi_g,3,For a sports and beer kind of joint; I was impressed! One of my friends ordered oysters... and actually got me to try them!! At a pub!! I'm usually a very picky guy; never thought i'd eat oysters anywhere else other than an upscale restaurant; but here we are. I actually ordered a plate for myself afterward. They were on a special too; a buck an oyster; compared to their usual 3$. Only downside is our food came all at different times; so it was a little awkward; half of us didn't want to eat infont of the other starving half; so some were sharing (that's how I ended up trying the oysters) some were waiting for everyone to get their food; so we ended with cold food ourselves; it's not our waitress' fault; the place was busy; and we were a big table; so I'm sure they were doing their best. We'll be back though; maybe a bit after the lunch rush next time; but we'll be back!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,ol6v1oKA62i-eBrO2UbVZg,Yx12GA2Bq-ixEfxtJA01oA,1,A touristy restaurant that lacks attention to the clientele; and quality of food. ..Our latest visit to Bier Markt for a weekday lunch turned out to be nothing else but an expensive disappointment. .Although I have been to Bier Markt twice before; this last experience took me by surprise as to how things changed for the worse. .Upon our arrival for a 1:30pm weekday lunch; we were seated upstairs to a very small; uncomfortable table; in a very dark sector. Quite depressing. I suppose the bright big TV and the blasting terrible music was the only thing that kept that sector lively. ..While looking around; I've noticed that there was another sector upstairs with windows and far more spacious and better ambience. Sadly; we paid the unexpected consequences of having a worse waiter service. ..Shortly after we sat down; our waiter arrived. So far things are going OK. Right away we ordered our meals. Mussels in a sauce and a chicken burger with fries. We were a table of two and both times our waiter was quite pushy in offering us sweet potato fries instead for $1.00 extra. Of course that an extra dollar for his tip. We said; no. ..Since we arrived for a late lunch at 1:30pm; we are quite hungry. So our 45 minute wait for mussels and a chicken burger was not sitting well for either one of us. Finally our meals have arrived. Not once did our waiter took the time to apologize till I very kindly mentioned the such long wait. His response and I quote Oh sorry; our kitchen staff had gone on break when I placed in your order; I'm sorry about that  Somehow my appetite was being replaced by frustration. As soon as we took a bite of our meal; both of our fries were cold and soggy. The mussels were warm-ish. My sandwich; well the bread was rubbery; the chicken was cooked till dry as sand paper. Again; I politely called our waiter and mentioned the fries. He said; oh sorry about that. Let me get you another batch. Soon after our waiter returns to our table and informs us that the fries will take about 5 minutes since they didn't have a batch made. So we waited; yet again!.Finally;y we finished our meal. I clearly indicated to our waiter that we were not pleased with our meal and the long wait. He simply said I'm sorry for that. The apology and the service both felt quite cold; short; and very unprofessional for a simple lunch of two people with one beer that costed $55.00
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,lLF9x4I41LFFKa_FX-lkbQ,NKlNiKQFco4_f3D20s6_qQ,3,Best beer selection in Montreal! 150 beers from 30 countries around the world. What's not to like!..Had a great beer flight called Je Me Souviens. I think I made a mistake by ordering their appetizers;  which were not great; instead of their charcuterie. Oh well; Happy New Year!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,_PutE0_1mFBUGm939UV_NA,mBPqYJ3J2Hxw_enkQJ6tYQ,5,By far my favorite place while visiting Montreal.  Great crowd; tons of beer choices; cool staff (Daphne is awesome!).  Tried many different beers; but ended up sticking with Stiegl.  All the appetizers were good...poutine with bacon; fried gouda bites; buffalo wings and flatbreads.  A little pricey; but worth it...Had a great time pre and post hockey game.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,JnxK5dq85pivUK8J9Cyj4Q,VofZRqti9q2hEST4U1v1UQ,5,Bier Markt; c'est l'usine; ok mais ça reste un joli pub bien soigné;..Bier Markt; c'est à éviter les jours de matchs (de hockey);..Bier Markt; c'est des écrans partout transmettant principalement les événements sportifs; et même le sport roi; le football ! (testé un jour de match de Champions League avec mon bon PSG)..Bier Markt; c'est une offre de bières très importante avec des bières pression et bouteilles; une carte soignée; tout est classé par type de bière ! des bières belges importées mais aussi des bières artisanales locales !..Bier Markt; c'est des offres de plats à manger assez correctes; si on ne choisit pas de planches (rapport prix/quantité affreux) ou de dessert (struddel bof) ... RIBS RIBS RIBS !..Bier Markt; c'est avant tout la plus belle flottille de serveuses à Montréal ... plus classes que des établissements style Hooters peuvent proposer; sûrement plus jolies aussi; mais elles portent à merveille leurs robes et leurs décolletés (attention les tenues ne sont pas obligatoires; à part le respect des couleurs noir et rouge ! Si tu ne veux pas porter une tenue qui te met en valeur; tu peux très bien porter le pantalon; et ça; ça reste correct de la part de la direction) .... désolé; j'peux choquer la gente féminine; mais avouons-le; nous sommes directement plus dociles; et plus consommateurs lorsque des jolies filles (oui en plus; ça change tout le temps) vous sourient; sont sympathiques avec vous et s'occupent de vous .... en 3 heures; je suis tombé amoureux 5 fois ...
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,QIAYd2t9Nnq0S4vD-zWNcg,hsovIbM0mc6wJsKXceRV1g,3,The food is good quality however you pay the price for it. The appetizers are very expensive and the main dish choice is not bad for supper. The beers are awesome though but again you pay the price for it. I was never impressed by service though. It is mediocre like the rest of canada (Toronto being the best I find) learn from the Americans guys ! Learn!!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,hOanhLERJDJoiO39c4tPKg,2Xm1Y9Wk3nqH2VCz54JA5A,3,Came here for a pre-game drink when the Habs were playing the Rangers.  It was packed.  Surprisingly; about half the folks were Rangers fans.  Bummer!  Regardless; I made some new Quebecoise friends and we chatted in my very rudimentary French.  Yay!  ..They have pages and pages of beer.  Unfortunately; they had NO cider at all!  I get it - it's a beer market; but still; would be fine to have at least ONE cider option among the hundreds of beer options available.  Service was good.  Easy place to stop in before a game.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,Hxy8zmPEcdzl-Q9lPqKIaw,Sd2Sc_jHiwiHavvc2Wr3JQ,1,Service was abysmal; waited 25min after being seated to order drinks and food. Tried to get a second drink and gave up after another 30min of waiting. Glasses were dirty and food was cold.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,k4xzJyW2FPMvy4TMUs4D0Q,nHYGwCXjMVTAnuTmJIT2Kw,1,The Bier mart is nice but very loud sports pub . The hostess is rude and very unprofessional. They do not honour reservations and basically do not care !!!.We sat upstairs in the corner where the lightbulb  was burnt out on bar stools. It took the waitress 15 mins to come to our table to see if we wanted drinks or to order food...We order a small house salad to start with -that was served  to our table 15 mins after our meal. Hello it is a starter not and ender ..I  ordered the large pot of mussels in beer with bacon. The mussels were dry and over cooked and there was a little bit of broth found in the bottom of the pot. The stale bread was not able to soak up the salty broth; the order came with a small order of fries for kids  which were not hot. You think they could afford to serve a proper size of fries. .My spouse ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which was over cooked and came with cold fries . .The waitress never came back to check on us until the end of the meal 15 mins later with the salad. Save your money and what a disappointment the waitress was nice but the service and the food is terrible This was a sure miss and was very disappointed in both the food; service and attitude ..Clearly the waitress did care and did nothing to what we said about the meal being over cook and was sure disappointing meal. Sorry to post a bad review but had to be honest !!!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,XOgqs74hkbXT54mSp7JMRA,G378PfMKZGDtXuU2nPL--g,4,Je connais le Bier Markt à Toronto. Je sais que le concept marche fort lorsque la routine est bien installée. Celui de Montréal est bien mais gagnera sûrement avec le temps. Intéressant choix de bières; concept bière/fromage intéressant...Bon service.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,6CD33Uw5p_uJsMny9FeKDQ,3,I have come here a few times for its wide selection of international beers! This visit; I went for $ oysters. No reservations are required. I showed up around 5:30 pm and easily got a table for 4 on a very LOUUUUDDDD hockey night (I could not hear myself it was so loud-where this place loses stars). ..The waitress was friendly and was able to upgrade our table when 2 extra people showed up. There was a period of confusion when our waitress said someone else would be serving our table- and nobody ever showed up! Consequently; we literally had to flag down a random waitress after 20 mins waiting  to order food. I don't get how customer services works if clients are waiting to order food - and we have to make the order vs being served...Aside from this mishap; I really liked the concept of their food menu-being only one page  both sided-simple and clean. You can build your own charcuterie plate from a variety of meats; cheeses; vegetarian options for a fixed price. The oysters were ok better than oysterfest! ..If not for the food i see myself coming back for the beer selection.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,hFIeYcOq7aXuM_UNnSx7fQ,s_Lq058jMNhY-MjVqFo_9w,4,Excellent list of beers on tap (one of the only places I've found Stiegl outside of Austria) and the pouting was quite good. Can't speak to the other food but I'm sure it's at least above average for pub fare.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,jykpFKe1UG3BBa1eI75dlg,_OJ-QD4Bh1c52miNrarU5g,5,Attentive service; great beer flight.  Got the poutine with bacon; green onions and creme fraiche; as well as the Brussels sprouts.  Surprisingly good!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,A6106ziyADZ_b6CvZNzkbQ,2,I have been to the Bier Markt on many occasions; and each time; I feel like the level of service is getting worse. This time; I was joining a group of girlfriends on a Thursday hockey night; there were lots of people and lots of noise so we could hardly hear each other talk but given the circumstances it was ok. Where I found the service to be poor is that at one point our table was simply without a waitress... which of course makes it difficult to order. ..I had to hail a random waiter who was passing by so that he could find a person to take care of us. I ordered a few oysters which weren't my cup of tea; I also had a platter with three choices ($ 18) prosciutto; goat cheese and as I wanted to take risks I went for their red tuna poké... which turned out to be brownish; tasteless with extra dry rice. ..In short; what made the experience memorable is much more the company of my friends rather than what was served throughout the evening. I think it's worth going there just to order their real specialty: beer.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,xvi81Db39YKVKaisSFjH0Q,HrwCb6SzenNfqOk1dh1pbQ,4,Great atmosphere; very sports oriented restaurant. They have a giant statue of a kid wearing a hockey jersey that you have to see for yourself. Great food and very fast service not to mention i had a perfectly cooked steak and it isn't even a steakhouse. There are two floors and the first floor has a very large open bar area for late-night drinks. Casual; touristy; trendy; and fun !
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,03zKqrZQYJjZlwK8yVMVuQ,5aEp-BHMxqw82-u1jevLSA,3,Good atmosphere and service; enjoyable experience with their Bier Flights - Je Me Souviens et Charmantes Europeennes!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,aklz9VcWWJDOFLbNk7t2Cg,4q3eYk_eEAFIw_Xd6sjh9A,4,We went there after a Habs game. They have an excellent assortment of beers. The beer cocktails are pretty great. I had the S'Wheat Citrus. The staff is knowledgable and super friendly. I had a great night with good people and even learned some Canadian history.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,yBbhNiEwzSf8T8xWvfTLhA,4p1ZKP0msx8WjNosc2mzyw,5,Spotted the place while walking by in the morning; and decided to stop in for dinner...150 beers; tons of big screens; great food - need I say more?..Great ambiance in the repurposed space of the old steakhouse. Great selection of beers; both on top and in the bottles...Poutine was very tasty; onion rings perfectly crunchy. Steamed mussels with bacon perfectly delicious; and enough fresh bread not to leave a drop of that tasty liquid behind. All together equal to a great evening...Excellent service - prompt; attentive; friendly; knowledgeable...Highly recommended.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,XduciX-f9ONDZ-rUhs3PfQ,BdGBt-HNgxfYIpA20C4WLA,4,Love this place. This place just happens to reside next to our hotel. Lots of beers on tap. Tons of bottled beers. The beer menu gives you an extensive description of beers. Food wise.  We only tried the charcuterie plate. While it was good.  It probably wasn't the best cured meats I've tasted.  Solid. But just not mind blowing amazing.  The beers we tried were really good.  Being in Canada. I stuck with mostly Canadian beers and all of them were really really good. Service was great. Waitress was super friendly and accommodating to our large group of rowdy guys.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,thmBJcmekcK9Q5vl4rusLQ,lFt2ARVCbRjXki50Iv6Wyg,2,Beer was good but the food was cold. I'm not one to complain but cold food is turn off. They re made both plates which I appreciate; but my husband finished eating his before mine showed up. Annoying. With so many great places in Montreal; we will not be going back
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,Um-SfzKnn3KRcvDRWbS8Dg,puqzyJOhlG6_uYexQ53Hvg,4,From a wide variety of beers from all over the world to famous Central European cuisine ; everything is tasty about this beautifully decorated restaurant ...
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,Ud46ptyN5u0iKEMauUHY8w,WiAa7Ew__kd8uDSQmvp9DA,3,Great beer selection (although imported beers are not cheap): they had delirium tremmens and hoegaarden on tap. the service was not very fast but the bar was packed; which might explain the speed. The food was pretty good.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,GL9vbvSBR_CymWZ9EvY3Lg,tMlqZtv1U7SF8jhx_IVkCw,3,Pretty good.  We had a group of over 20 people and they were able to keep the service level pretty high...I'm not a beer drinker; so I stuck with Caesars... They were very good!  .The pre-ordered appetizer plates that they brought out were good.  I liked the hot wings the best.  I ordered the bacon poutine and wasn't blown away though.  The gravy was just far too salty to really enjoy...I'm sure we'll go back for work functions; and I'll be happy with that.  But it's probably not something that i will suggest.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,TZBIjCMQ684ZtNMXpoFeyQ,050cLx4Mhnrvy_cwR1WnYw,4,First time in Montreal!.Walked  couple blocks to the beir market. It is a modern style lik pub..Its in a great location downtown montreal.Tried the oysters ($1 every wednesday and Thursday) they came with horse radish and some vinigrette. They were rather tiny but tasty. Had to request tabsco sauce..Also tried the poutine! (With smoked bacon and chives) absolutely delicious. Rather small so not a great sharing item. (You wont want to share :) )   the cheese curbs were quebec style super tasty and melted all over the fries! Amazing!.This restauarent also has charcuterie style bords you can chose 3 items for 18 dollars and so on. And assortment of meat; seafood; cheese etc. Some pretty nice options..Tried this with curry yogurt sausage; scallop civiche and smoked pork belly. Sausage was different but tasty! (2 small pieces) Pork belly (4 small pieces)was delicious .. the scallop civiche was very small and combined with yoo many peppers and cucumber to the point where it was probably only 1 single scallop cut into tiny pieces..The restaurant has over 160 beer to chose from! Happy hour is from 5 to 8pm beer for 6 dollars;  select variety..Th decor is red leather/wood and dark lighting. But lots of space..Service is good..Taxes are 15 percent in Montreal!

JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,5EM7JlbNWw4jblBgQV1AfQ,pUr4mtQHP9sW0KaLuBNeHg,1,Our party of 18 arrived at 615 and after waiting a half hour our overwhelmed and in impressive waitress finally came around for our food orders. It took over two hours for our food to arrive. At no point did pour waitress come to our table and apologize for the inexcusable wait time. The absentee manager never came to our table and we had to track him down regarding the status of or meal and when we finally located him he gave a hollow and meaningless excuse that it is busy tonight. If their management staff is under the impression that waiting two hours is acceptable then the root of the problem starts from the top down. If you like tourist traps with overpriced beers and subpar wait staff then this fraudulent beer garden is right for you. I am writing this review at our table and it's 930. The waitress is no where to be found and our glasses are as empty as our patience as this hoax of a beer garden.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,zJW_GMeyHsBa9PQOjfacUw,8dfqg4B0_v6jT_gIHJ8o6g,1,Well if you like over priced beer this is the place . The Bier mart is nice but very loud sports pub . The  2 male hostess were rude and very unprofessional. They could not find our reservation at first and when they did they sat us upstairs in the corner where the lightbulb  was burnt out on bar stools. It took the waitress 15 mins to come to our table to see if we wanted drinks or to order food. Save your money and what a disappointment the waitress was nice but the service and the food is terrible..I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which was dry (over cooked) and asked for vegetables instead of fries  was suppose to but came with cold fries . .We order a small house salad to start with -that-was brought to our table 15 mins after our meal. My spouse ordered the large pot of mussels in beer with bacon. The mussels were over cooked and there was very little broth (which was very salty and bitter) in the pot. The stale bread was not able to soak up the salty broth; the order came with a small order of fries for kids  which were not hot. You think for $20 they could afford to give a proper order size of fries. The waitress never came back to check on us until the end of the meal 15 mins later with the salad. This was a sure miss and was very disappointed in both the food; service and attitude ..Clearly the waitress nor management cared when we said this was sure disappointing.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,CfLulYKEKfPclmbdt_YzVw,ZebBULrZODkDa0wj2lep-g,3,Pretty cool place but nothing too special. Pricey menu; decent beer list; really good service; decent atmosphere. ..It was fine; I would stop by again if it was convenient but wouldn't make a special trip.

JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,cqagyVkvbBB32agnJsIhVA,avRJUMpKsoQSE7Hd7ynWJw,1,Sorry that I didn't go elsewhere. The Pretzel-Breaded Calamari just seems like regular calamari; unless they simply meant that it was going to be over-salted; which it was. The onion rings were fried at too low a temperature; because they were soaked in oil. The Pastrami Style Salmon was so overpowering flavoured with mustard and spices that it will almost impossible to tell that it was salmon at all; And what's with the Frank's Red Hot with everything. Really; can't make your own tasty sauce; you need to just put out Frank's on everything...Don't go here for the food. Even if it says Resto first on the front window. The food was apparently a complete afterthought.

Terrific selection of beers and a big fan of creating your own flight of beers which didn't disappoint. I went with a mix of porters and IPAs and threw in a Cider to mix it up all of which were very good. For dinner I went with a sampler plate of Tuna Poke; Scallop Ceviche and Sausage. Well two out of the there were really good. I did not eat the Tuna as the fish did not seem fresh and the white rice it was served on was not cooked properly; stay away. The star of the evening was the Duck legs; WOW!! Fall off the bone good and the spice rub was great. If the Tuna was better I would have given a 5. I will absolutely be back.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,O4x9ltPiJxwfaVwNzYDgPQ,ljwFcxqISF5Nz9H_mGAKZQ,4,Solid food for the price. Yes it's high teens for a dish of pasta at a joint that advertises their drinks; but Ive found the food to be pleasantly savory. Kudos to the chefs back there and to the hostess who found us a seat within minutes on a Friday night. For draft beer it's Alexander Keith's. Freshest I've tasted outside of the Midtown in Halifax; NS.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,pTCx_tNZ8P-CvkBariXasQ,NioOFkfkPaeOKJ2bJBVBag,4,Stopped by on my first night in Montreal. Great beer; good food; friendly staff.  No complaints. Solid four stars!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,1NbFusAiFMOLT1vOUyVr8Q,MSmJvA8p0i_usOJl_C7o3g,1,This place is a tourist trap. It is located across the street from the Sheraton Hotel. Went here this past Friday during lunch. I ordered steak with fries. When another waitress brought and placed my food on the table; she just placed it quickly and left without noticing I did not have eating utencils. I had to wait another 10 minutes for my server to come back so that I could ask her for a knife and fork.The steak was charred and chewy on one side. After I ate; I was still hungry so I asked for the menu again. I ordered a soup. After 30 minutes of waiting; I canceled the soup and asked for the bill. I informed the waitress that the steak was burned and showed her the pieces I had chiseled off; but she didn't seem to care. This place is expensive; the service is horrible; and the food is not worth it. I also overheard the lady next to me complaining that her salad was not good. Being that this is Montreal; and that there is plenty of culinary competition; don't waste your time with this place; unless you are just coming to drink.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,LUHwtIgfclx_9PKfJJQ1YA,Vm56--aiUxi6ScL6X2juiA,4,The good: Great variety of beer choices. Awesome beer menu. Staff is friendly. Lots of people and yet a lot of seating places. Handicap bathroom upstairs while regular bathrooms downstairs (smart). Nice bathroom design...The bad: Can be awhile before you pay your bill. Can be loud and rowdy. Expensive (8$ to 60$ a bottle)...If you are a beer amateur; this place is for you. You have a lot of variety to choose from and it is a great place to hang out. Give it a shot!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,sNBsp8dKRkwi_ZRpwQX60g,IIO9V0vDY3P_XSD8FEa3Ww,4,Amazing beer selection gives this 4 stars.  They have a menu that is very organized and helpful.  They also have 3 flights (samplers) available that give a large portion of 6 beers and allow you to try different styles.  The best beer of the trip was the Dominus Vobiscum Triple; from Microbrasserie Charlevoix.  ..My wife had the muscles Provencal; which she said was just OK.  The wine sauce and garlic was very good.  Large portion size but small muscle size.  I had the poutine with cheddar; steak; mushrooms; and pan gravy.  It was one of the best poutines I have had; but the portion was rather small...I would come here again a few more times just to go through all the beers.  There are some less-than-exciting beers on the menu that you could get at any chain restaurant; but it is more than offset by the harder to find and local selections...I would give it a 5 star rating if my wife enjoyed her muscles as much as I enjoyed my poutine.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,1qa2Ui6_pt_N5O182BiExg,Fzc1wzuuDcbS5b5wwiPrVA,4,Really enjoyed this place; I had a delicious lobster fondu which was rich and tasty. The beer selection is overwhelming but they have a sampler for 20 dollars which was a good choice to savour a variety of  delicious beers; and then next time you will have an idea of what to order. Stay away from their flammekueches; its dry; un-flavourful and sad. Steak is meh. You come here for the beer; so maybe stick with appetizers or the fondu.

Je l'ai trouvé un peu trop cuit; et un peu sec...C'était bon mais ça valait 15$ max... .Au moins la bière en accompagnement suggérée par notre serveuse était très bonne...Pas sûr que j'y retournerai; même si c'est a côté du bureau.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,Bl98NAmKPvCRi-Z5U2atWA,SSSzI2Gbo5J2sK8tydAD5A,4,Ce soir; je devais assister à une conférence au Sheraton à côté et j'avais 30 minutes pour manger. Je suis donc allée au resto le plus près; en l'occurence le Bier Markt. ..Staff efficace; dynamique et attentif à mes besoins (c'est-à-dire manger VITE pour arrêter de me plaindre que j'ai faim et que la vie ne vaut plus la peine d'être vécue parce que mon estomac est vide) et à ceux de mon accompagnatrice (lire ici: stagiaire). Une impressionnante quantité de bières en fût et en bouteille (150 bières; t'sais) disponibles à des prix raisonnables: choix difficile; mais OH qu'elle est satisfaisante; la bière; après une première gorgée. ..J'ai commandé la poutine au bacon confit; parce que BACON + POUTINE. J'ai passé les 10 minutes que j'avais pour manger à dire à quel point c'était bon; entre deux bouchées (ou la bouche pleine). La taille de l'assiette me convenait à ce moment parce que j'étais pressée; mais j'en aurais pris davantage en temps normal. De là l'étoile en moins ;)..Même combat pour mon accompagnatrice-stagiaire: elle a commandé un(e?) flemmekueche au poulet BBQ et j'ai vu le bonheur; le grand; le vrai; dans son regard...Ambiance lounge-bar sportif-rempli d'hommes qui parlent de business en complet-cravate parce qu'on est dans un coin d'hommes qui parlent de business en complet-cravate. Cela dit; peu importent vos chemises; mesdames et messieurs; l'important; c'est vos papilles! ..Je vais très peu au centre-ville ces temps-ci; mais quand j'en aurai l'occasion; c'est certain que j'y retournerai. MIAM!

JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,T4R7f55tGu_F7VmNjxEucA,5G1r3E7_fEBxrxeX-izH9w,1,Ok - pre planned group of 47 arrived at 6:00pm - drinks flowed but appetizers didn't arrive until 7:45. Worlds smallest salad - consensus description. Duck legs - ok but bland. Water not replenished until 8:00 pm. It is now 8:23 and no sign of main course. Host requested bread or something to tide us over until food arrived - no luck. Drinks still flowing - although weak. .Can see LeCage aux sports from third floor and guests ready to leave. Save your money and go to LeCage Aux Sports or anywhere else.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,P7iuHke0ybK3HDzLJ0LaZw,nEYs7yPQeE28bO4Ltd0grw,3,150 beers; many on tap. Clean; trendy and generally very busy. Service is good but food is hit or miss. On one occasion I had the raw oysters which were fresh and delicious; accompanied by 3 nice sauces. I also has the PEI mussels Provençal with pommes frites and they were nicely steamed and aromatic. Nice dinner. Another time I had the veal schnitzel and it was barely edible. Overall I enjoy this restaurant and will try other fare. Just so you know their charcuterie board and fondue look amazing. I'll try that next time.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,YYyQ7qPPU_TXmaQ7Q4u6nA,s22gyQrXJOv9n4KTDBbMKw,3,First night in Montreal. It was near the hotel. Very loud sports bar with expected frequently yelled expletives. We shared a full rack of very very dry ribs and a tour of their poutines. The poutines were all tasty but would have been improved had the frites started slightly more crisp before adding the rest of the ingredients. Nice beer selection of 150 from around the world. The staff was friendly but not particularly attentive. As it is close by; we will likely give it another try.

Le cadre est beau; l'ambiance aussi; et pour les amateurs de bière; vous pouvez essayer quelque chose de nouveau à chaque visite. Les serveurs sont très connaissants du menu. Il y a toute sorte de gens qui viennent partager un moment ici; des tables hautes; des banquettes; ça a beaucoup de cachet. Dommage qu'il soit SI DIFFICILE de trouver des places de stationnement assez proches...
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,71j43dQmXgMP8WuWuzXC3A,3,Nous y sommes allés un mercredi soir pour un 5@7 entre collègues..Nous avons eu une table en haut; et jusqu'à 18h; il n'y avait pas trop de monde. Après; ça s'est assez rempli; ce qui a fait que le service était vraiment long... Nous avons attendu nos plats vraiment longtemps (on avait faim!) et pareil pour de l'eau ou la facture...Dommage...A part ça; bonne bouffe et bon service
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,eKsRMibLGNlWWG1Blg77WA,vJxjcJNpQp1o4KlaN-dVpw,4,Good location and excellent service. We were a bit in a hurry and our server made sure our plates came fast. She was very helpful. .We ordered the schnitzel; the portbello goat cheese burger and a small pot of mussels which were excellent. Everything is a bit pricey; mainly because of the location.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,D5XcP5iQp51MF3SW_ZfX9w,c4XzxGRURJ-UfoLtQ7KWuQ,3,The selection of beer is extensive! The handbook they give to choose your poison is descriptive and easy to navigate. I will say the waitresses didn't really inspire confidence in regards to what they had for drinks (I don't expect them to memorize the whole book...). The food is delicious and pairings are suggested. What stopped this place from getting a 4 on 5 is that certain beers on the menu were questionable. For example; a bottle of Corona was simply overpriced. Not really a menu exclusively for craft beers. But hey; one man's trash is another man's treasure. I would go again with friends.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,r1n_0dI5JKPz9bRzWDEf6Q,xeMtpH0RL-oRenNFeUG_PA,4,Great place to hang out with friends; anytime! Prior to a hockey game or just to hang around. Great and too much variety of beers : it so amazing ! The beer list is thicker than the actual food menu...Despite being more like a sport bar; the actual food is better than most well-known type of restaurant...Btw; they have great specials/deals everyday
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,3kQsPgVgGkJ_FjCSXkWxzw,VJeR8kr0U2AuiATJU0BpTg,5,Over 150 choices of beer from over 30 countries...the type of bar that has been needed in the downtown area for a while! Atmosphere is great and the food is awesome.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,sWlSRkEQbFCeMT5lISQJPQ,-TmplM7KQdQK-kahWG_JrQ,4,Great beer selection! I visited Montreal and this was a great place to get some food and a few beers.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,9G_sADIxqlw7VasElCK_eg,Uq7fKz7Q2ecwazHOJcO9Kg,5,Fantastic food and great service and the atmosphere is vibrant. Impressive beer selection although they have cider and wine as well. The poutine was excellent; as was the schnitzel. The duck wings are an interesting alternative to chicken wings. Finally; both the creme brûlée and the waffle ice cream sandwich are outstanding. Highly recommended!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,EDhf9DnFoek69nEY72lPyQ,gPms_naoTcJCyzvO84WUbw,3,The ambiance was nice; a bit too loud for my taste. The beer selection was definitly huge and I had a beer I used to drink in Germany; it was unfortunatly very expensive... 9$ for a beer that in Berlin is 2€. ..The food was good but not impressive; we had the crab dip; the mini sliders; the fried calamari and a poutine. The crab dip was our favorite!! We did have to ask for more pita chips because they bring very little with it...Overall it was a nice night; but a very average experience. I would not really go there again...________________________________..L'ambiance était bien; la musique était un peu trop forte pour moi par exemple. La sélection de bière est définitivement énorme. J'ai pris une bière que je buvais tout le temps en Allemagne mais elle était très chère... 9$ pour un bière qui à Berlin coûte 2€...La nouriture était bonne; mais pas excellente. La trempette au crabe était très bonne par exemple; on a beaucoup aimé; mais il a fallu demander plus de chips de tortilla parceque il n'y en avait pas assez...C'etait une belle soirée mais une expérience très moyenne en fait. Je ne pense vraiment pas retourner.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,E66x_C8wcrdwr5u16YBvFQ,YsWz8EGUuNAgO47LBSt_GQ,4,If you like trying different types of beer this is the place. Our server was great and was very knowledgeable on their beers.  The food order came out in good time.The menu had duck wings. They are worth trying. When I come back in the area I will visit this place.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,6IDVxxDxs0j1vaIYYtHplg,cpwH2BR-_okQCYXEvF3Onw,1,The food is very good and tasty. .Unfortunately we were served by an unbelievably impolite waitress..It took them 40 minutes to bring us our food and even a glass of water. So we asked nicely why is it taking so long; and if we can have some water.  She took it personally and told us excuse me ? you know what? Im gonna make you wait even longer now..And she even told us who said all the restaurants give water? Have you been in all the restaurants in montreal?.It was a terrible service and the employee seemed extremely furious and clearly didn't like her job..It's very upsetting when a place gives very good quality food but the staff ruins it all. I would never recommend this place to anyone except if you're drunk and want to get even more drunk.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,zL-y2UwwhlPf7VK8Bhevrw,s2EWXAsCEpPKt7ykgboayA,1,The sports ambiance is nice. The beer selection is outstanding. The service is good. The food completely sucks. Worse mussels i've ever eaten; they were smaller than green peas and didn't tasted anything. My wife had ribs and it was hard like rubber and didn't have any taste as well. The owner should review is food.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,og0aBF1SkDI84YnSVsOoEA,AKhLkvj5I4oW4NIa-ZdkaQ,4,This was my last stop before heading to the airport to return home. The restaurant has a huge beer selection. The menu is typical of a Belgian restaurant. I had the mussel and fries. It was delicious. The waiter was very entertaining. I enjoyed the place.

JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,HFxugTIOR39cB8hBWDDyHQ,Vi2GY6uaBbSxdbTzFsNO0A,5,Bier Markt has now become my goto spot for team lunches and business lunches. The new menu that was introduced on May 21st brings some great new dishes. ..Specials of the day tend to sell out quickly; so if your a little late for lunch - you may miss out.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,SPxVxXeGoE2qMejvDXu3tg,hGTJvn7PJpACXcVykXrLlw,2,This review would have been five stars; if I had just left my visit to Friday; instead of coming again Sunday night. ..So I came in on Friday evening with my boyfriend; our server was amazing! She was friendly; super helpful and knowledgeable with her menu (she gave great suggestions that I ended up loving); and she checked in on us as a server should...Now; I'm not from Montreal; and I have been a server myself for nearly a decade. I'm a firm believer that no customer owes you a tip; and your tips are a reflection of your service (that; or maybe the customer is just cheap af; who knows). With that being said; here's how my Sunday evening at this place turned out:..My boyfriend and I were spending our last night in Montreal close by our hotel (we stayed here for three days; on Victoria Day long weekend). We opted to stay close by; just to save time on having to travel back to our hotel seeing as though we'd be leaving the next day.  We decided on coming back to bier market since we had a good time on Friday. We walked in (downstairs was pretty packed) stood by the hostess stand for a minute; and I noticed the bartender (no one else was on the floor) being crazy busy; you could see on her face she was prioritizing what she needed to do. Since no one had approached us we decided to seat ourselves. Grabbed a high top table right in front of the bar.  We sat there for a few minutes; STILL no one had approached us; and I began to tell my boyfriend about how much I can sympathize with the bartender because at this point it seemed like she was working the entire first floor alone; and I remembered how stressed I was doing the same. So we patiently waited. And she finally came along; before she took our drink order I asked for a food menu; which was my mistake; cause that added another two minutes to our wait time. We finally got our order out of the way and then our food and beer came. ..While sitting there; just observing; she was totally running around like a headless chicken; at this point it seemed like no one else was working in the place; (which I know wasn't true because more than enough people ended up downstairs around closing time). She had sooo many dirty tables with cups everywhere sitting for over ten minutes before any other workers came around to help. ..At this point; that's ridiculous. You don't leave your staff hanging like that. Even if their service is amazing; no single person can handle over forty people in a room without hella delayed service; and leaving the place looking like a disaster. Yeah the money might be great at the end of the night; but your shitty service will be remembered. ..So near the end; we asked for another pint each; and the bill. Bill was brought then paid. As a server; I've been left pretty shitty tips. But hey; that's life; you get shitty tips with shitty or excellent service. You're lucky to even receive a tip at all...This bartender; I don't even know her name because she never told us; nor was it on the bill (I could be blind if it is)  came back up to us to ask if there was something wrong with our time there. I already knew where this convo was going to go; and I knew my big mouth would just get me in trouble so I left it up to my boyfriend. She proceeded to remind us that a normal tip is roughly 15%. ..Ok hi; I would leave NO tip for someone who gave me shit service; because again customers do not OWE you anything. I would throw a hundred dollar bill at you as a tip if I believed you deserved it...Anyway; I only encountered two servers at this place; and this place could use another lovely server from Friday for their Sunday evenings. And maybe schedule another server because this bartender can NOT execute great service in a place that big with that many people. Again; if unless you were superwoman; I don't know who would be able to...Don't come here on a Sunday unless you want to wait
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,kJ4lojFBpi5utB1Djke2WQ,xQwCRAJ0dx2ssMp1gbVT8g,5,"Great downtown place to enjoy end of day beer and amazing schnitzel. The veal or pork one; you won't be disappointed. .Perfect for watching a game; group meeting. .Once you go; you come back -)
KXITXbKuE60WSUDs7NZVLQ,nU8JTKxz-oK-k-llXZWPZA,xL55zC9svyId2BHLWbDA5A,5.0,My husband and I love to try new restaurants; so based upon reviews and our previous dining experience at emrils fish house we decided to eat here. My husband ordered a beet salad and I ordered a crab cake as an appetizer; they were both tasty. For dinner; my husband ordered a 4 course meal  which consisted of a bbq shrimp; a bowl of gumbo; and a grilled pork chop. I ordered the lobster carbonara. The food was great and tasty and the service was good as well. We definitely will return here or try another one of emrils restaurants. We were so full we passed on the desert which was my husband fourth course!!
s2B_ZeSGTlQ3qbm0dOY5rg,1jgHer0B9CS1DtFS5a_5Kg,AvNPOGpdLaIkGRAAJVZ1CQ,3.0,I know that this location just opened so... I'll try to be a little easy on the negatives......Let's start with the negatives:..1.Frazzled staff. I went on a weekday and got there right at 2pm; usually when the lunch rush is winding down.  The place had many employees but they all were running around all over the place and when I entered; I was asked to take a sit after I told them I'd be dining in. I sat for five minute as waitresses walked by me a hundred times before I had to get up and say Hey; can I get some service? They were really polite and apologetic. ..2. Over-priced. I spent $11.00 and change (plus $2.00 tip) on a chicken sandwich; gravy fries; and a soft drink.  The quality is maybe one step higher than fast food places and maybe one notch lower than franchise restaurants like TGIF or Chilies... yet; the price up there with Chilies. This is due to them offering only one combo for a burger; so if you want a burger and fries and not a chicken sandwhich (fried or grilled); it's way more expensive as there were no combo options (I asked). ..Really; that's all. ..Pros:..1. Atmosphere. It is clearly doing the 50s vibe; with the layout; decorations; colors; and oldies music playing.  It was relaxed; had plenty of space; and is overall a good place to go to lunch.  It was very clean; obviously since it just opened.  ..2. Food. While overpriced due to no combo values; the food was good. I'll be trying more menu items as time goes by; just to get some variety. It's greasy; it's fattening; it's delicious.  My fried chicken sandwich was tasty and this being the first time I've had gravy fries; I am now a fan of them.  As I've said; I would say it's one notch higher than fast food like Zaxby's; a place I really like by the way; and about a notch lower than TGIFs; another place I really like; so this is a compliment.

No need to try the chicken tenders & waffle fries because they are so ordinary. I should know... because that's what I did when I first came here. WTF was I thinking?! Definitely MY BAD; lol...Luckily; I had some of the hubs' Crispy Chicken Waffle Sandwich and it was so good! Chicken wasn't dry at all...Also; get their strawberry lemonade. REALLY good.
Q-XOV0IdOhogd4BERz7JOg,iuzdL-fyp6Ib8X18k_3t0g,_P26hzn3uA17jbX007A9Vg,1.0,Generally two to three times a month we go to the Einstein's on Bell and Grand. The service is never exceptional but it's always courteous and fairly quickly delivered; the order is usually 95% right. Today however; I suspect I won't be the only person posting a review or sending correspondence to HQ. We waited in the order line for close to 20 minutes (max in two years was 10 minutes should also be noted there was no one in front of us to order only in the to pay line). While we waited for someone to come and take our order; we witnessed a customer bring back her incorrect order three times; two customers request a refund because they had been waiting close to a half hour for their food. We witnessed overflowing trash cans in the food prep area; garbage all over the floor; a manager who was snapping at her employees;and not fully listening to her customers who had complaints that needed to be addressed. We watched Employees make each order without wiping down the food area from the previous order; so cross flavoring/ possible contamination was happening.  Employees were on edge; customers were becoming more and more irritated and the line wasn't moving any more quickly. ..If this was my first visit to this location; I would definitely not return. This can all be easily rectified;by retraining employees in prep;and unfortunately putting a manager in charge who exhibits better customer service and organizational skills...UPDATE: It took 23 minutes to get our order after paying. Food was lukewarm.

It was our first time here and we were trying to figure out the specials vs. the regular menu.  We asked what kind of rice was offered.  He said; and I quote; it's yellow rice.  That was it. ..The rice was yellow; yes; but it was also fragrant with strong spices.  Not a bad thing; for sure; but way more than the young man offered...Ordered the chicken shawarma pita with hummus and a gyros plate with salad and rice...Chicken shawarma was very good.  Lots of flavor; but only warm; not hot;..Hummus was okay; but not exceptional...Gyros was acceptable; but not remarkable.  Sauce offered in a small cup was like tzatziki; but tasted more like tzatziki with some kind of ranch sauce mixed in.  Wifey confirmed.  ..Portions were adequate; no problem here.  ..All in all; I'd give the experience a C-. Not great but okay...Oh; and another thing that made us slap our heads: why is the pita bread COLD??  Can't they grill it and crisp it up??????  It tasted like it came from Safeway!   What the heck is up with that??
Fi-2ruy5x600SX4avnrFuA,6ZYzX25uKWRQQNgwezwo6A,2bsBOa7Xf2k7PzpcPtKfgQ,2.0,Pros: line moves faster than the other Buffet of Buffets lines we've been in..Cons: the food is nothing special. We came for lunch and dinner since we stayed at PH and were disappointed both times. The food was very ordinary and doesn't live up to the Vegas Buffets expectations.

aYjZc-3aVbPIPaJgGiUK_A,hQ7GCAaeLAu6LSgGGUMNvA,P-gfWodwVKm6c6vV5k4XMg,5.0,Dessert stop on our progressive dinner. We were late and they were supposed to be closed. We stopped in on the slim chance that we could still have dessert. They welcomed us with open arms. Jesse was our server and she was outstanding! I had the salted carmel gelato and it was outstanding! They serve the gelato with coffee over the top and fresh fried doughnuts. It was so delicious; I actually picked up the dish they served it in and drank the melted gelato. Super tacky... I know. You can't help it! ..My friend had the cheesecake. It was equally delicious. Creamy and sweet with tart raspberries. ..Jesse was wonderful and was polishing glasses while we were there. I couldn't help notice the care she took. She wanted everything to be perfect for us; her guests. Top notch service!!!!!

wAnyasMaWy4WvlkzwHyApg,t8D5N0WUGVkWcPrXZD07Yg,UjvX7SYXsZ2qdkytLnn2mA,2.0,I typically like Metro; their produce is usually good and staff are usually nice; but I was picking up a pre-ordered sandwich platter and a fruit & veggie tray for work one morning and the customer service really left me with a bad impression. I waited for at least 5 minutes trying to get one staff member's attention when there were 5 staff at the counter; and they were sort of snarky when I finally was helped. I won't place an order from this Metro again; even if it means that I have to go out of my way to collect my items.
313pOZvjvoi6QI5oXgtRHA,dQh7xaIJo0xrpOusiS6yTQ,OGyZZtw6mFays0-tBjPCKg,2.0,We had dinner here after a play at the Mesa Arts Center.  Not the worst but definitely not the best place i've ever eaten.  To be fair; I didn't try anything on the wine menu.  The gluten free menu was the attraction and i suspect that has attracted a few others as well; especially on a Sunday afternoon when not much is open in Mesa.  It's ok; but I wouldn't go back again.
f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog,FO_etH5T8-Fr-CMYWc2ZJg,8SBQjMG5LHJZuE1Tq3mGEQ,4.0,Very delicious; very refined; very service oriented.  This restaurant should be on everyone's list.  The food is local; fresh and natural.  The chef is innovative and the wine list is exciting.  I will definitely return here every time I am in Vegas.  A complete hit!
rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A,4UEb06NPzJqKJWYtmBHBhA,5EekNO2yoHbHwA1fa5cdkA,5.0,Fantastic French cuisine experience from Thomas Keller. I'm always amazed how delicate and subtle French food can be. ..I had the Croque Madame; which was superb. Also the coffee was outstanding. ..This is a great place for breakfast / brunch.
f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g,CCJDnE1IqesiWzf1PPAGTg,98EdrgK6E45hAL5mRoSbmQ,5.0,I had the steak and egg special and it was amazing. The mashed potatoes were perfect and the steak was cooked to order. In addition the kiwi watermelon lemonade was perfect too. Definitely coming back to hash house everytime im in vegas. Especially those late nights and alot of the places are closed.
DZkl5MleRKh0isxj1Y2Abg,osUnTtEAKrH7gkeXSRqaig,t7Y7-63sxqWSxSl4vECdPQ,5.0,This place is TINY. If you're coming here for a first date; be prepared for everyone to hear what your hobbies are and how horrible your last relationship ended...I live in Yorkville; so I come here once in a while for a quick bite; the staff are always friendly and polite. The food is simple French fare. They have a great cheese and wine selection and there's also outdoor seating for when the weather is nice and forgiving.
GIfZNMP0oIJCje_Xp0Bgrw,JxIHMxZ3OQLue_MCrxNw0Q,Hp04zmUs_bRDs7n5vdfkwA,3.0,This place has a cool; sort of rugged hipster atmosphere. I love how cozy and casual it is...To drink I had a spiked hot cider cuz I was freezing; and it definitely warmed me right up. I also tried a drink called Cleveland Roots I believe. Interesting idea and earthy flavor...I had a whole bunch of dishes with my family: the pork chop was delicious; and I'm a sucker for a good chunk of fat on my meat; so props for that. Carrot tots are a cool idea; tasted fine but could use less salt. Turnips were fine. Fried fish was fine. Chicken wings were fine. Foie gras steamed clams were something interesting...We had the funnel cake and pile of leaves (I think that's what it's called) for dessert. Funnel cake had a nice; subtle pumpkin flavor. The leaves dessert wasn't really memorable; although I recall enjoying the candied nuts that were a part of the dish. ..This place has a serious price tag for what you get. You end up spending a good chunk of change for some tiny portions; which isn't really that awesome if the food isn't spectacular. Food was good; but it didn't totally rock my world. Maybe it was an off night? Who knows...Overall; cool spot; food is a bit of a mixed bag; but go and see for yourself.
BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,RoJCMSycQZGEefAh8-OHJg,QtqPvY7EuyQpkLRQ-kDrEA,1.0,Pathetic excuse for a restaurant . You can't just slap a famous name on it and serve mediocre food and service.
3Z4pcWY2xnyZumGmsoXIVA,xIntNTewEdzBJff0wNPWrg,7sbQgEDXkww5YLH-1PC6Xg,4.0,Went here during opening week!..As far as coffee goes -- they know their stuff. They knew where their espresso beans were from; the specific roast... And my cortado was perfect. A little pricy; but honestly not a problem if you value high quality coffee... really state of the art...If you have trouble finding it: itis next to the train; underneath the roof there. Kinda hidden...As far as coffee shops though -- more of a stop-in place. Very minimal seating (1 table; 1 wall bar); no where to sit and have a private conversation; which is a bummer. If someone asks if you want to get some coffee? I would not recommend here; for that reason.
Oq_NXf50o4U-cTFWlVkyGQ,xzMBV_7wzGs_QnLA3rUM8A,wuCaHr5A6fANvFhonYERQg,3.0,I need my Coffee daily. I passed this place daily on my way to work and so today I decided to give it a try. Well I wasn't that impressed after I pay for my seven dollar caramel coffee it was way too sweet not very hot. But the service itself is what gave it the three stars not the coffee but the service. My order was taken properly with a very friendly voice over the speaker. And the gentleman who served me and took my money was very pleasant and polite.
NTtLuuBKpywlyIz6oyd9kg,6ZqmyxWoq0B7xqg6dlbbtg,ukorfPn4AFQ5nfcF3fL_kA,1.0,Was shopping and decided to try something new. When we walked in it was a cute little spot and the staff was very friendly. We looked over the menu and order water. When the waitress came; we both ordered bento boxes which were recommended. I don't like miso soup; so I asked for a double serving of the ginger salad; and the waitress said not a problem. I also ordered a Sapporo. The waitress brought out our salad and soup; and there was a creamy white dressing on my salad; I asked what it was and she stated it was a creamy dressing; I explained that I asked for ginger dressing and she ran to the back to fix. After a few minutes wait; she came back with a salad that had what looked like a soy sauce/oil dressing on it. I have to say it was absolutely awful!!! It tasted like salty; oil and dirt. I then motioned the waitress to let her know I still hadn't received my Sapporo; which I now needed to wash down the dirt taste in my mouth. ..After about 15 minutes; we were served our bento boxes; which although looked appetizing had no flavor. I stopped eating and so did my friend. Within 10 minutes; both of our stomachs were turning; and we immediately left the restaurant. As of this morning; we were both up with horrible stomach pain all night; and I'm pretty sure we both have food poisoning.
t_9dmtogyjAocFsNW1igag,3kOiqN8FUDz54CsbdfaWRg,SIXZ4MWBiqTX97UuXb8ARw,5.0,I went at night with friends -- it was a cold night and my Carmel Apple cider hit the spot! It was so yummy-- the Carmel/apple ratio was perfect! They were out of apple juice & used little juice boxes to make my drink. It was so kind for the barista to go the extra mile! And I love that it wasn't busy at all! I even found a little birthday gift for a friend while i was there!!! Yea!
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,iLwYEwgfZnmSHriT-LNm0Q,823nybTa-w03YT6w6fI6uw,4.0,Always pleased with the food. Staff .... had some good experiences with them. Margaritas are on point.
8yAVuMwtijEosdjiCrtyXQ,4VDWeuFD0f6jAeFlZa_UAA,xWX08DvnYs_AyeB6rOHEaA,4.0,Great place for a custom personal pizza. Personally I think it tastes better then the other custom pizza places I've been to. The new Pieology off of Chandler Blvd doesn't quite have things buttoned up like this place. The only issues for Fired Pie is the crowd at lunch; and trying to find crushed red pepper when everyone has taken the shakers.
voCIHFZndkVQjz8VgJKrFw,JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,xZtG4qgpq2QLkfKgyYXq8w,4.0,ATMOSPHERE: Looks like a typical brunch spot. Not much decor and it's located in a little strip on the corner of St-Charles. Doesn't really stand out in terms of atmosphere...FOOD: I personally LOVE their potatoes. They're pretty flavorful. I do find that their eggs benedict are a little bit lacking in flavor but it's not bad at all. Their avocado on toast is also quite good (still lacking in a bit of flavor). But to be fair; I love my savoury foods and spices so maybe it's just me.The good thing is that the breakfast usually comes with a cup of coffee or tea. Their portions are also pretty big if you compare it to other brunch spots...PRICE: Standard prices for brunch...SERVICE: Their service is always pretty decent.
YzqV61exMv__mjobBV2g7g,0URpICC5-RDn1mrRfwWyzA,4aAXq1tsaD09y0fxkHnE3w,3.0,Came here for lunch on a weekday with the bf and during our meal; I noticed it started to get really crowded; which meant this place is a go to spot for Thai food. The lunch prices here are very affordable and the service was friendly. The fried wonton pieces they gave us before our meal was sort of stale though. Anyway; I got the pad see ew and it was okay; borderline pretty good. It wasn't as flavorful as I hoped it would be compared to the other Thai restaurants I've been to; but again; it was still good; just not memorable. You also get a good amount of food too for the lunch specials. We ended our meal with the mango & sweet rice dessert and it was tasty. The rice was cooked perfectly and the mango was ripe and sweet. Overall the food was good (A-ok); but I sort of feel like I've had more flavorful Thai food at other restaurants. But I can see why people come here for a quick and affordable lunch especially if you are craving Thai food.
vpqC4f2zvAPTDbNBNC5Hiw,KtkTiuCW1ddm-g4uC6acXg,z7iFESzkffDZOodKNS9seg,4.0,After working at Paradise Bakery for 6 years; I swore I would never walk in there again. Well; I still find myself addicted and visit the Ray/101 location about 1x/month. Too expensive for my taste (even when I worked there; I knew I wouldn't be in every day like some people because of the cost) Almost $10 for a half sandwhich/salad is a little absurd; but it is really tasty. I like trying out new or limited menu items; like the salmon Caesar salad (freaked me out a little that the salmon pieces were all shrink wrapped and just plopped on top right out of the plastic) but it was still good and I didn't get sick... But my all time feel-good sandwich is the Chicken Walnut and either the Fire Roasted Tomato soup; or the Southwest Caesar salad. Oh; and the chocolate chip cookie that comes with the sandwich. It can be swapped out with a different kind; but I thoroughly enjoy the classic chocolate chip. When winter rolls around; I can't wait to get a Ginger Molasses Cookie and a Chai Eggnog Latte....yum!
lWmDrnqgU6w3gFaJyn_1Uw,RpTiJnFdp0PsW2_ZgpABig,af9hUUoCA9sT6qtzYXR4_g,4.0,Ordered off the tapas menu and had a delicious meal.  Big fan of the roasted garlic and also the eggplant.  The pictures on yelp are very true to the dishes.  The service was attentive; but I was close to assisting the waiter with opening our wine bottle.  It was painful watching him struggle.   Overall really nice outside dining experience.
f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g,qq9T4WGZ7dIPGqS1jA9a3Q,stGEk_yovA8Dwx6ng79jdQ,3.0,5 stars for my first visit. 2 stars for my second visit...We stayed at the Linq so Hash House A Go Go was a convenient breakfast spot. Besides; twisted farm food sounded interesting so we decided to give this place a shot. Ended up waiting no longer than 45 min for a party of 2 for the first trip. Second trip had no wait because it was late at night...SERVICE: The first time around; service was awesome. Our server brought everything to us in a timely manner. However; the second time around; at 3AM; service was dead. What made me laugh was the fact that as the server was filling our glass cups and ran out of water; she nonchalantly said oh ran out and never came back to fill up my water cup. I was so thirsty from the disgusting corned beef hash and dry biscuit. ..FOOD: For breakfast; the food was awesome. I had the gravy biscuit mashed potatoes thingy (idr the name) and it was savory and delicious. My girlfriend ordered the flapjack not knowing that it was the size of Yao Ming. The second time; I had the corned beef hash which was my biggest ragret. ..Overall 3 stars for this place.
Fi-2ruy5x600SX4avnrFuA,IJGQALx4pMF_kk5c3x8hqQ,s-zOk0oC4iKWsI0rp8n7Rg,1.0,Had heard wonderful things about the Spice Market Buffet so wanted to give it a try. I am Indian so was excited when I saw tandoori chicken; chicken curry and naan at the buffet but I was extremely disappointed. The tandoori chicken was absolutely not marinated; they just added a crap ton of red coloring to make it look appetizing. The naan is not really naan but just pita bread...false advertising?..Out of all the sections; I probably liked the seafood section the most but was a little careful because I didn't want to eat too much seafood and get a stomach ache later. The Asian section was horrible! The lo mein was so dry and the chicken looked rubbery and fake; again...I was extremely disappointed...I could keep going on and on about all the crap food but I think you get the idea. The best part of the entire buffet was our server. She was very sweet and the only reason I'm giving Spice Market a star is because of her...Weekend lunch price is $30.99+tax/person and that is definitely a rip off. For the quality of the food; it should be more like $9.99/person. .Kinda bummed that we shelled out so much $$$ for horrible food but it happens and at least we gave these so called amazing buffets a shot...never again.
BLvcA14BVJYSPjaVnNUKFg,QDahZGlk7UdPbPDDDAfGbw,NbIGf7X_Hz7r_TUn4tSRLw,5.0,One of the best places you will go for excellent ice cream and great service. We have been here twice and the owner makes you feel as though you are his most valued customer! Whenever we are in the area we will be treating ourselves here!!!
j2bx_ctb_ED3zbfSaqhQmQ,yOM891kAdwni5ecnGsQcWw,Nmm2tc0bJ_5pTuPIGNKrTA,3.0,I'd really give it a 3.5.  lol..Came here on a FRI; EARLY; and the place was bustling!  More proof that no one in Scottsdale cooks for themselves.  ;)..The service was a 4 for sure.  Attentive; without being overbearing...At our table; we had the mixed green salad; the duck breast; the mixed grill; and the big ass burger...The mixed salad was fresh - nothing amazing or different.  It was pretty typical of a balsamic salad...The big ass burger is well named.  The thing was disgustingly huge; and unless you have a big ass appetite; you won't finish it.  It also has a spicy chili on it; so if that's not your thing; whip it off; or your tongue will be burning...The mixed grill was well done; but again; many of the items were spiced - the shrimp and sausage both had a kick...The real disappoint came on the duck breast.  :(  I had ordered it medium; thinking it would still come medium rare; and it came rare.  NOT happy.  But; I was starving; they were busy; and I didnt want to lag behind everyone else by sending it back.  It was sliced into pieces; so there was no excuse to not cook it to temperature as ordered.  Came with a nice onion relish (spicy - lol); and braised cabbage...Deserts were huge.  We had the lava brownie and the pecan pie.  Both served a la gelato...Overall; there wasn't anything we ate that made anyone say; oooo!  you MUST try this!.  The food (besides the duck problem) was prepared well; nice presentation; but there was nothing that was overwhelming.  The atmosphere is nice; the service was really great; but there wasn't anything on the menu you won't find anywhere else; nor was it prepared nor presented any better...I would consider it like a Kona Grill.  It's good for what it is; but nothing spectacular.
ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ,WZUdg6WvG6gDKm5CHK5pzw,Tiih9tphtXPscQ8cZMnUmw,4.0,My friends and I were definitely hitting boba up before we left Toronto; and we stopped by Chatime towards the end of the day. Phew; there was quite a wait (generally a good sign!). I got lychee tea with boba and lychee jelly and it was quite good - good tea; good boba. Worth a stop if you're in the neighborhood for sure!
umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,SoiacX2r2mvHqIh3GgRMUw,zghgGbyYkDEDudApPLEDbA,4.0,I absolutely love this place! Since the minute you walk in it is so cute and different. They great you with an edible menu and you choose your main dessert for your 3 course deal. It is very small so it makes it more exclusive. They only serve dessert so if you are looking for food you are at the wrong place :)
Zw9wEAk9L6oTZi63f4zVvA,RBdZV3-Mi8_fRSQnxq__PA,PxpHeU3Kv7HTJ73N7FJXTw,4.0,really cant go wrong with hot pot. the service needs a bit of work. Takes too long to get orders; food; check etc. However; casual trendly and good for late night food and dates. ..The meat is frozen. not a huge fan of this. but all in all would definitely go again.
ml916FaOdF870Jrk0ZQETA,vBXU9hLHuSkqHOXRC4847g,DPVI6xSxFMDS2694pGS8_A,1.0,Love the matzo ball soup. Went in today to splurge and get some which by the way is $8.99 for a quart of SOUP. I figured it was worth it since I love it so much. I was highly disappointed. The entire quart was broth with absolutely NO chicken; some noodles at the bottom and so much celery I had to throw it out. Also it's supposed to come with bagel chips; I got 4 broken pieces of plain bagel chips. Last time for me ever. What a rip off. I will be telling my friends about this too
gYxnLUnjSEYBduLeYETirA,K0nGqinlojACyzpZlZnIxw,18oWRHp-f6Q_Ac-0L4XlLw,4.0,I'm sad to say that as of writing this review; the resteraunt has closed. ..This was one of my fav joints for spicy hearty food. Their lamb with cumin was always tender and flavorful and the lamb skewers were moist and meaty. Alas; economy hits hard even the best of food places; and I've never seen more than one or two tables full in the place. Staff are SUPER nice and friendly; but their employees have dwindled down to mostly family members. ..Food is in good portions; delicious; but a little heavy on msg. I'm giving it a 4 rather than 5 because they really have not decored it great and the ambiance is a little low.
Wbi-x-1Nbn6LFCMOSN6F5Q,-NFiJu-wDyNaLxuczdDg4Q,Q3Gf4fhYICh0j95UO15TDA,5.0,I just wanted to say how amazing Lisette is. I'm sick and came in with my baby (with a carrier) for some tortilla soup. Lisette was so kind and thoughtful to help me carry my tray; get me silverware; and fill up my drink. I didn't even ask. She offered. That is amazing customer service and she deserves to be recognized. What a difference that has made in my day

JcAfn8YTNnoAUk9nGaioSg,AOQ0yHh-QGTX6H3bgFR16A,47D6_MpYxwzWJcbLdGl83w,2.0,just another blah donut shop. nothing special. probably won't stop again.
Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA,eFW9iCEHQiGzATY_gRo9uA,hvAGIwobgoBqIRE-bPVgBQ,1.0,Ordered pepperoni pizza and salad. Got only a pizza; it also had red peppers on it. I probably got the wrong order because I didn't order red peppers and there was no salad. (I was on the phone when it arrived so I didn't notice until driver was gone). Emailed their contact info on their website; undeliverable. Not pleased.
WdBWhGe4Siqg3IYTc4_K4A,F9glLZz7TI2U9Y97fliX_A,vXqD2SJEsd04_r2MoSWsDg,5.0,This place is great; love the food; prices are reasonable. Huge menu with lots of options.
gQXeLTrzLcsMOr0YjqbJ7Q,PSc3miQpdYkdrpJUThvquw,MI3WBxm5WsiyDVt6HNqwgg,2.0,Only gave two stars because they had the ice cream I wanted. I just have to say maybe Vanessa should be more focused on her customers instead of having a personal conversation with her co worker. She rang my items up (didn't say hi or anything) bagged my items; handed me my receipt and said have a good day. Where's the customer service. Not with Vanessa.
8nmjvYX4N67cxOsGfbEgjg,rJj8VvpQvn6qdpPKzauqrA,RGarBgn-rBBEyaKKbVN6fw,3.0,Great Movie Theater; Terrible everything else...We heard the service was poor so we ate before we came.  As far as the movie theater; the seats and table placing are good and the sound and picture was awesome.  If I was just paying to go see a movie this would get five stars...However; from the time we pushed our request for service button it took over 10 minutes for someone to see us and another 25 minutes to actually get the drinks.  The drinks themselves were terrible.  We ordered a margarita and a Caribbean Hurricane. ..Don't sit near the aisle because the servers use the aisles throughout the entire movie and can be distracting at times.
kd8v68rmPA5KE9TtBx-4AA,cmUswSxbNcJosCufuoD2fw,YbZc8Q-c06H5MfCqbMvs7w,5.0,We love coming here!!! They make very good pizza; the slices are huge and prices are very reasonable. Also it is nice to have a locally owned cafe in the area.
KrwGJBrSE3kN721yx-MzfQ,64LzEtOhF2eYbGCtE86tsg,m72HbGsEevjsFxg_VZV1CQ,4.0,Pretty good I like two pieces of thick pork; but I can taste the msg(dashi) in the soup and it was quite a bit salty. Also; it would be great if you guys put more sprout beans or other veggies into the soup. The service is very good. Staffs are very friendly and I like the music in the store.  Also;  I think you guys have to divide the thickness of the noodle into three sections( very thin/ thin/ thick). I ordered thick noodles; but it was actually thin; while I was expecting very thick noodle.

Le Station W offre aussi des grilled cheese qui ont l'air tout à fait délicieux ainsi que des muffins et autres gâteries. L'endroit est lumineux; très propre et on a envie de s'y installer avec un bon livre ou son portable pour faire quelques travaux. ..Heureusement; c'est tout près de chez moi... Quelle joie!
npXeRfXeL6gRvuF_nXn0hg,YBT3EKUNN4IP8m4x7sGu1g,6mMkuxmRN7aJ1MumFKgLbw,5.0,Drove by there on Saturday.  Something just drew me in - and then I realized.  This place is real.  Rich; gorgeous aroma of buttery goodness in this bakery (no oily smell); just pure butter; always a good sign.  Mmmmm.  Bought a pumpkin pie - crust was crisp; not doughy; just thick enough and the filling - smooth; not too sweet and perfect melange of spices.  This place is REAL.  Totally agree with the earlier reviewer.
UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw,lXpb2r2wc_gvJ-QWe8KS4w,gVRVwmfVGVNWTF3UwpI6ZA,5.0,Food is seasoned great!  Love the Lemon Pepper Shrimp sooooo flavorful with that kick of spice that keeps you eating more! Great Prices; Great Food.  Much better then Boiling Crab All around! Great to take your first date to see if they dont mind getting dirty! Crabs; and Crawfish Delicous! Initially ate here because was seen on Man Vs Food; and got hooked on the Flavor! Careful when you leave cause you'll definately smell like the YUMMY food you just ate!

8yAVuMwtijEosdjiCrtyXQ,PGn2x3GNhIqlfqz2CM4NUg,WGR682eloKCiwQinU1r7Ww,5.0,Bestest in Gilbert! Thw accessories are tastier. The dough is thin n not thick to overtake the toppings. None to compare with!

Staff is super friendly and environment is always clean. I also recommend going to any events that they have going on from time to time such as beer fest or cider fest!
W36vefYka0IZAPWygxJtqg,gWaUoiHidYWuarN4vmGMJg,MTfgfK7kvJxsZR8_ZiVBWA,5.0,I ordered for the first time from Johnny's tonight based on yelp reviews.  The pizzas were awesome; especially Johnny's Deluxe.  Prices aren't cheap; $49 for 2 pizzas but ingredients were fresh and tasted great. We will be back for more.
t33qVzQ6AdSiq4lnI0KOyg,uphk41I8yPJ2KyYrMQOefQ,IJdwm0XWGPvIE3F6GnUKww,5.0,I have never had a bad experience coming here! We had a groupon that included a tour; our tour guide was super informational and at the end he recommended the most tasty of beers. This place is usually busy; especially during happy hour though. They have games to play while drinking; which can definitely get competitive! This is one of those bars where most people are there to hang out with their friends without getting obnoxiously drunk. This place is a must try when going downtown!
e-ZkvfbMZi628OKVcoFOAw,VdVb5Eipk1B5uupaC3J_0Q,hCwKZCcpwFyckT8qhjAXzw,5.0,Build your own sushi burrito or bowl or choose a premade one. Sushi Fuku offers a variety of authentic tastes; and you really get your money's worth when it comes to size and quality of meal. An added bonus is that they include a few nutrition facts with every item that they serve. Also; the work staff is friend and quick when preparing your meal; and the sit down area is cute with a young atmosphere. Sushi Fuku is a well known stop for any sushi lovers in Oakland; and I'm just another patron!
TQPxHfKykLLG6echeHru-g,fHG0UALsw91_EhbQFL9oXg,eY13zhTwOZtSsPGua43u_A,4.0,Great place for a casual cheap eat. It tastes like the mexican i ate in california which was pretty authentic. I recommend the place.
GmdujALb1Nq2RHGr7jhCaA,HyAAsCY79JtNBjjU7pn_dQ,53ZBxf26JxVb5JksV-6v4A,4.0,Hwaro stepped it up on my recent visit with service and food turned into 4 stars! The All You Can Eat Korean BBQ hits the spot. Workers gave quick and friendly service... they were all definitely on point. This restaurant has great quality meats with 3 dipping sauces along with plentiful fresh sides! I also like how they give you a container of water so you can refill your glass which is cool. My faves here are the: bulgogi; brisket; and pork belly!! Yummy yummy.~
1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ,qFtrm6pVFrOrdMo0d1xJQw,cGnqPyylC7TXFPI33xlriA,2.0,Ate here on a Tuesday evening.  It is a very pretty location; and service was  good.  I really didn't care for the food; however.  The bread with the oil and parmesan cheese was good; but I didn't care for the sauce on the pasta.  It just had a weird flavor to me. My son liked his chicken parmesan so I guess I would have to get that if we went back.
7_n9hWnaWKRCUOLNPlBLwA,WnutazQRy8QoD0quFq6MfQ,Q7g0RuKQrU8OAmPppkP2aQ,5.0,After researching many bakeries for our wedding; we decided on Caked.  We're from Chicago and planning a wedding in Las Vegas was stressful enough...so I had asked around for recommendations as well as spent hours on end on-line and calling around.  I'm not sure why this is; but I found that; for some reason in Vegas...vendors don't return calls! ..So; first let's talk about the service.  I had left messages for 4 bakeries to call me back or email me.  Caked was the ONLY one that I got hold of and had returned my emails right away when I had questions.  Caroline; the owner; was attentive with me (as I had a gazillion questions) and she never made me feel rushed on the phone.  She helped me decide on the assortment of desserts for our dessert table; as well as helped me with the cake (decoration & size; based on # of guests we were having).   She even gave me suggestions in order to help save me some $$!!! .....and she went over & beyond service expectations.  I wanted a specific cake topper and certain rhinestones on my cake..and instead of sending me all over town and online to find it; she offered to go buy it herself!  ..As far as the look of the cake; it was EXACTLY what I wanted to the tee!  And as far as the taste...... our guests raved about the cake all night!  A few people even said (and I quote) I've had lots of cake in my lifetime...this was the best cake I've ever had!...(ok...seriously)!  I sound like a paid advertisment..but I am dead serious!    ..Of course the desserts were awesome (although; I didn't have but maybe a cakepop; which was yummy) but as the bride; I was so busy all night - really the only dessert I had was the cake.  And I LOVED it!  It was 3 layers:  1 layer - red velvet; 2nd layer - chocolate w/ chocolate mousee; and 3rd layer - vanilla w/ bavarian cream.  Red velvet is my favorite and as anyone who loves red velvet knows; it's all in the filling and the cake itself that makes it good.  Caked cakes are moist and the filling in this red velvet cake was perfect.  ..I recommend Caked Las Vegas to anyone looking for a bakery who will work within your budget; give you excellent service AND deliver a delicious and quality product!  ..Thank you Caroline and thank you Caked Team!!!!
bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg,zPaeFGQ_TtyHVGN88AfGLg,CSVUgcHN_c634Bc6N23GgA,4.0,We had breakfast there on Saturday morning.   Yelp says that reservations are recommended.   Take them at their word.  45 min wait at 11am.  It was worth it!   Excellent service and food.  My wife had the Red Velvet Waffles and I had the eggs crab Benedict.
e5-fDENYpBTNwX6cHFS3Ag,3rmSsD1OEISBOT1zcgmZVA,Wz-wHW2oE50E7qYGW-hsbA,5.0,Food was piping hot and delicious. The mint tea was quite a surprise. The creme brûlée was awesome - definitely worth the calories. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. Will go here again.
3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA,Jx3dP4kkKonDSrWCRH_oMw,xNygiP4G1q1Sa4IJ3RDtsw,5.0,Sooo good! After trying many disappointing Indian restaurants in Toronto; this is one of the best we've been to! The chicken curry and lamb curries were AMAZING! Full of spice and flavor and properly cooked! The naan also was excellent. .For good Indian food; it's well worth the extra $2-$3 dollars that they charge per dish compared to other places... The service is friendly and professional; with a nice atmosphere. My only minor complaint is that they don't offer tandoori dishes; probably because the specific tandoori oven requires a difficult to get and expensive license! ..Try Curry Twist! If you love good Indian food; it's very satisfying.
x1fx7C_tc064cFATjl4fmQ,CdRAT2M4U0gChhCu94IARg,msNIneNlPf8C6ZkVYkLdCA,5.0,Place is on point with their new menu and the payouts are on point. I would definately swing through if you're a local or just passing by.
UDyScSvpzBEgOGs6HAXcRg,18TbnUiuaO7qJES5B4JOzw,j5SgMK4ask0sDDPo-xzHnA,5.0,So good. Went for the lunch buffet. 9 bucks. Everything was amazing but the mango chicken; curry chicken; and jerk pulled pork were highlights. This place is a gem for anyone that wants authentic; amazing food at a ridiculous price. I want to try the dinner buffet next time im in town. .The ladies working there are also very nice. The decor isnt anything special but I hardly noticed. Great food; great price. Go in hungry and leave happy.
LQ_gYNs5E10IGFE0NOyD7A,vG9sjEY7U6ee2BZrCs2MCA,Usgx6SNvq4RF52cdbccJUQ,5.0,Came here for the Fiesta Bowl. We sat on the brand new; ficus surrounded patio with heaters. Food and service were excellent. Friendly staff; delicious food- my foodie friends raved about the oysters and garlic dipping sauce for the fries. My husband and I liked the steak and fried chicken. The pickles were yummy and a chef secret. A definite place for foodies and normies alike.
DwmAsemahJywywhuqv5J1Q,s49XcBEol0Zf4HsvB6TC2A,TeI-aKD1lZ_smlNEIJEemQ,4.0,This Oakland establishment has Delicious food! Can't wait to order in a few hours! If you are looking for good Chinese; try it!
qbCPF1Z-Dher2MYUYFCX4Q,1opsrVjl6m4IXf7Z7Ib2gw,ni3G60mn6emzUectA6gidA,1.0,What a terrible place.  Don't usually eat at Macdonald's; and don't remember them being this dirty.  Staff messed up two out of four of our orders.  Staff goofing off.  Where was the manager?
CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,ARbXI0dtE6bpclIqMx77jg,lz8D0qmN9dfiFGe4teHseQ,5.0,We visited this place the other night for a snack.  The snack turned into a full meal and we were stuffed by the time we left.  The nachos; bean dip; and salsa were enough for a meal.  And one margarita turned into two.  Smooth; salty and refreshing and you just wanted more of them. I had two grilled fish tacos and my husband had the chicken fajitas.  Everything was flavorful; and a generous size.  We will be back for the good food and service.
EzEgGjT49Fq90cCuFpD9LQ,Dy_RhvtedHyYcP3mK5ZKtA,AcD15jPcv9AkNfZskFQMDA,5.0,A friend told me of this hidden gem near her chiropractor.  I joined her on her  next trip to check it out and loved it!..It is a bakery (from pastry to bread) but they also serve other snacks and food as well. They had this rice ball that was stuffed and had a deep fried mozzarella coating; yum! I had one of their mixed deli sandwiches;  yum! Followed by their version of chocolate lava cake; yum yum!. I enjoyed the food!..My server (not sure if she was also the owner lol) told me I should come during day time and take pictures (coz their stocks is filled with fresh bread; and I was there at 5 pm). ..Whenever my friend goes to her chiropractor I will definitely tag along and try new things. So yes I wpuld recommend it =).
d84_mtSFHt8xgYTly2T-9A,2VKVhy1SwaixHCeiWglLUQ,V5dAu3wQ9mtAMNg9pTm8cQ,2.0,I was in the area looking for a quick sushi fix and decided to check into Sushi Time. I was surprised to see so many fowl reviews; especially since this place was the first sushi bar I had ever tried more than 10 years ago. Hungry as hell and maybe even curious about their horrible rating; I decided to pop by anyways and order a makimono set...Well I definitely remember enjoying sushi here before but maybe my tastes have broadened or their quality has declined or both.....The soup and salad were good as per usual so props for not botching that up..The rolls were big and full of rice... I wasn't too impressed with the flavour either. The spicy tuna was odd... there was no spicy mayo; instead it was a roll of tuna with a spicy salt. Even the dynamite roll was kind of meh...Would I protest angrily if someone insisted we come here? No; but with so many awesome sushi joints n this city and the immediate area; there is no need to subject myself to lacklustre sushi.
aLss5tIa5rl4NJrhn7zPlg,kK-NklR8rOBsdBXL4oJLZg,FJxM0_XwXTvb8enmqY0Xow,2.0,The drinks names are cleaver but the drink itself? Just no. I did not like it and the pricing was ridiculous. $4.70 for a tiny cup...yeah never again.
WO1sgbYB6u6VVcvChanp5g,Aq1mWb2K3b-Rpko5HG5TSw,i2x31FP5uzgMlYvDpHAMaw,4.0,Open 24 hours; parking lot; clean; well-lit; relatively close to the strip; not overly expensive; tasty; and very good service....a much better option than Denny's.  ..Had Bi Bim Bap and a combo Cold Noodle with BBQ Short Ribs.  We did not feel like cooking; thus sat at a non-cooking table.  Noticed that the waitresses help you BBQ your meats at your table rather than just dropping off the meats.  Good selection of side plates and they refill with no problems.  Short Ribs were thicker cut and tasty.  Noodles and Bi Bim Bap were also good.
1GoI8TV5ngDEqoTmDK6Iow,xHQxvFLZFlQRv1CGxN9bzA,zFe3FPoxA6uORqRA_XXG4Q,5.0,My favorite mexican restaurant in Phoenix; hands down. Family owned; they are always friendly and love their regulars. I have not had a bad meal there and especially recommend the Pollo con Queso ... and the fajitas ... and the shrimp tacos ... Suffice to say; I've never had a bad meal there.
jkFIgs5FTmxlfZy9sCsx5A,MydYq5iMmRNVNk4K-GnXgA,eMQMEbyP8pIvGqQR-NZKWQ,5.0,Organised a tasting event here for work and had the most positive experience on two counts. ..First lets talk about the amazing customer experience I received from Colina who is the sommelier. We had spoken once on the phone and then invited me down to see the space to discuss the tasting in more detail. We could have done a more informal tasting in the entrance room but as our event size went down she gladly moved us into the tasting room. When discussing wines for the tasting she was extremely knowledgable and worked with us to stay within our price point. Nothing was an added cost surprise at the end of the event. ..On the second count; what a great tasting. The room is beautiful and well laid out. When we arrived each seat was set with our tasting glasses out and poured. The table also had a large selection of cheese and charcuterie for us to enjoy. We were given good information about each of the wines; varietals; and vineyards. Colina had great stores to add and you can really tell she has a passion for what she does. By the end of the tasting everyone was incredibly impressed and commented what a great event it was. Loved that all the wines tried were great value for money as it gave people an opportunity to buy a bottle they had tried without breaking the bank. ..Love the event for our clients. I will personally be back for one of the events they put on through the months. Amazing place. Go in to pick up a bottle and take in how beautiful it is in there.
Wbi-x-1Nbn6LFCMOSN6F5Q,stWAQtb3PiVBjsOn_roL7Q,_Ezw5AisRAgxEFQ5Q2EY2w,3.0,If it wasn't for the fact that I love the Barbacoa so much I wouldn't waste my time here. The service is always average to poor. I usually swing by on my way home from work anywhere from 7-10pm and about 30-40% of the time they don't have something prepared or ready. I've been there when they've ran out of barbacoa; steak; queso and sauce. How do you run out of sauce? I get not cooking more meat based off the time/demand but not when you are open for another hour or two. I'm also the kind of person that doesn't go to places when they're only open for less than 30 minutes to try and avoid these issue...Here are some guidelines:.Come before 8:00pm.If the line reaches the black stanchions just leave (guaranteed 20-30 min wait as they don't utilize the other register) unless you really want Barbacoa. That and the queso are the only superior items they have over other build your own burrito or mexican places. .Run out of meat: Go to Chipotle across the 215. Don't reward them for bad practices make a note to tell them nicely and leave. .I want to say a change of management would improve this place so much which is sad because I think they're relatively nice people. .Also; please greet the next person in line or the only person in line. Doing other duties while talking In Spanish to other coworkers doesn't bother me as long as I know that you've registered that I exist and am not just standing there for a minute. Seriously; something that simple and easy would go a long way.
91sdZ0d-5RMXNcBYB3uU0g,CrOLsMfZmPaMviu2bxg4Aw,P-GyOfyPLUM9XHrphLgbkw,4.0,What a great atmosphere. Service was awesome and quick; so if you're looking for good Italian food right across the Port before a nice marina stroll; you're in for a goodie!..Nonna's Pizza: a crisp thin dough that worked great as a folder; covered in a well seasoned red sauce. Vegetables like artichokes and spinach could have been more plentiful for my preference. The cheese was delicious and soft with a light saltiness. A good share for two!..Meatballs: oh man; these were good! A great texture and flavour. I've had some that were over-seasoned or drenched in red sauce; but these were a healthy balance with a nice cheese. Could have used more crostini though... three is NOT NEARLY enough for these guys!..Get a seat on the closed patio and you'll be loving it :)
lN4wmlhRagSZMF6YlOGNtg,AF96rgG5vAYC8SRKU3AHDg,BPiNRRc0MQI1rOt2mvG2kw,5.0,Went last Friday night for my first time. Was on my way to Jimmy Johns; but decided to try this out. It smells fantastic when you walk in. The gal was really helpful and gave me a sample of both kinds of chicken; the steak; the Barbacoa and it was all good and made it hard to choose. I ended up choosing the spicy chicken taco salad. It was a very generous sized salad. The gal then gave me a sample of the horchata that her Grandma makes from scratch. It was delicious!! Had a great experience and will be going back to try the burgers!
6VePv7drDpoG20ytyBFh7w,TMilGgbY0iUdiGulPFC3Xw,eiioPc6fEyyqomyaBu1URg,3.0,A wonderful stranger at a coffee shop told me about this place. I went in with high hopes....yet left disappointed. I must have arrived at THE BUSIEST hour. There was a line and all staff were doing something super fast. The menu had ALOT of delicious looking items  (a little too pricy for me) but hey; I order a garlic egg bagel and tried it out. They got my order in and had the bagel done within about 10 min. Not too bad. However; the bagel was too salty. They might have used garlic salt- I'm not sure. The bagelwhich a little too small for the price and not doughy enough for me. Either way it was filling but; I'm not going to be going back.
wPVEI29NxwH70IjNXJiNrg,YYj9g5Sg5weEMqcr6tPNUw,hCOe6U7pZgmkI-lL6bbC5A,1.0,Wow; the subway did not have great customer service. The food is ok but what makes it bad is when they do not treat you good and this subway needs a lot of help; maybe the person I had was not happy or something.
eTfX5DHGDN4Bryp9KC4Xjg,w_PyyaK-7Knpl_pIQfum3A,ZDxaMNBAVPPcP_G-mhRYvg,4.0,Who ever came up with the idea to have a coffee and ice cream bar is genius!  How could you not want to hang out on comfy leather sofas eating frozen custard all day?  Especially when you can get free Wifi too.     ..Leap's offers some amazing topping combinations and has a large variety of topping choices so that you can create the custard treat of your dreams!..My custard was a little on the soft side; like ice cream soup; but I'll definitely be going back to try it again.
rSKWpGKiaGkMZeX6ixb2Og,Fad4WxQe3GxsylQIQsZfmA,JINLJB_DfmyFMLs-zRjamg,5.0,This is probably one of my favourite restaurants on the south shore. The pizzas are delicious and packed with flavour and the seafood linguine is one of the best I've had this side of the Atlantic! ..The atmosphere is amazing as well as the decor.  Definitely a great place to go with friends.
3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,ck2fWsZHCJRH7FvkpG3prQ,IC8zNLy4kwiS95HqToPtmw,5.0,So good. I had to order two things. The cranburkey Sandwhich was delicious. The the sweet potatoe fries that came with it; best I've ever had. Be prepared to wait in line. This place is busy.
1veVZUawy7IhIc5oDpRRQA,OoDMQ4YIjQehunbKBEux4Q,9xgL0v0DaGVqEmB-J4u7dw,5.0,Sorry had to correct my spelling from the first time..So I'd love to be able to tell you that I've tried a bunch of different things on the menu and that everything has been excellent and that is why I'm giving Slyman's 5 stars.  But sadly; I can't;  I'm giving it a 5 because every time I go I get the biggest best damn corned beef sandwhich I've ever had and I'd hate to miss out on it by trying something different.  I'm sure that all of their monstrous sandwiches are excellent but to date I haven't been able to try anything else.  Its a huge sandwich easily enough for two people in share; I may attempt to order a pastrami next time or maybe i'll bite the bullet and order two sandwiches and then I can still have my love along with trying something new.
E25-2ssHwsajyGtsllMXaA,YztPBAV6L8e0Te_3_Q-PGQ,MuFPhFPcp3kKWt7wNkm2lg,5.0,O-M-G!!! I LOVE MRS. WHITE!!! (And her chicken)..We actually saw a brief piece on the Food TV channel about Mrs. White (The Best Thing I Ever Ate Show... on Fried Chicken). So we knew we had to go. We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!..We got there about 7PM on a Friday night... and the place was really dead. Only one other table...there was also a lot of writing on the walls... so I was a little nervous. But Deseree (our server) made us feel at home. ..The menu is easy... ALL meals are $13 buck. You choose from several main entrees... and about 8 southern soul food style side (you can pick two). ..I ordered the fried chick; sweet potatoes (yams) and the black eyed peas. My wife got the same but had the mac and cheese. ..You must also order the Kool-Aid... HUGE glass... and many childhood memories. ..You get three ***HUGE** pieces of PERFECTLY seasoned (and cooked) fried chicken... and the two sides... unbelievable! The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL! ..We could not even finish half of our meal... and we took home an order of Mrs. White famous Peach Cobbler; which we enjoyed with coffee after we got home. TO DIE FOR!..In summary... GREAT MEAL! Great casual (almost divey) atmosphere. It was fun reading all the famous signatures on the wall. ..Thank You Mrs. White!!
9Rs7n2LbINBN8kLbScjhmA,J6PV6LE7MMQj0ia0pW-L4Q,HtVeiaR2HDGl2SfXHytTgw,1.0,I'm surprised but not surprised that this place closed down.. I never left a review for this place; but was reminded about that one crepe place with the rude staff. I looked them up only to find out they're closed now anyway. So... I never actually got to try the crepes. I came in one day and asked how I would go about ordering a crepe to go. I felt like I asked very politely as I had never been there before. The owner basically shoo'd me away. Made me feel crazy for even asking and said something about it ruining the idea of a crepe.. I still don't really understand what point she was trying to make; but a simple no would have been better than her rude attitude. I literally just walked away and was thinking to myself alrighty then; guess I won't be going there ever again.. they lost a customer that day for sure.
HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg,WjwASvmHQGoqwgMVnVdNyw,NyX-rEtA2Q531OF97TIVcg,4.0,Great service; quality and affordable food. Definitely my new place when I'm craving Mexican food. I like the fact that they serve white meat chicken with their plates.
nwHd2MbIGz0SNG8GpFjekw,njWTp_CZ4KNtyPJeNWQ8-w,ZWpvpSAlUGvHKG-pplCEpg,5.0,My husband and I decided to eat here on a recommendation from a friend who visits Phoenix often.  Bottom line - we loved this place!!!! Great food; great prices! Staff was very friendly. We both also loved the decor.  We both ordered street tacos which had tremendous flavor and good portion size with sides of rice and beans.  Would highly recommend this restaurant!
dqO24yvvHJc5jgHm3LcliA,eTEEfd08L98uDDIeoMWI9w,UU3ay4qIfYPEmjEQJXQp8Q,5.0,Mmmm...I went there for lunch today and their pizza tasted soooo good and the service was great!
u5wmbtWjMyaiJpAbP2xoEw,ruSJ4yaLjZoeZbtIJaCxng,aPLwGN8JGxaQrkPa2jffkQ,2.0,I went to the Fish Market during the Charlotte Queen's Feast $30 prix fixe menu.  I've wanted to try Fish Market for a while but the prices have always turned me off. ..I feel I didn't get what I paid for as the portions for the 3 courses were very small.  I was afraid this would happen as it tends to on prix fixe multi course menus.  We were very disappointed with the amount we received based on the price we paid.  Thankfully this wasn't the case at other restaurants we visited...I started with the She Crab soup.  The soup was phenomenal.  I could have ate an entire meal of only this soup.  However like I mentioned above the portion was minute and I would guess I was served  less than 1/4 of a cup...My Entree was the Pan-Seared Mahi Mahi .  The fish was ok.  I've had much flavorful Mahi Mahi at other establishments.  The lobster risotto was very good and my date's favorite dish...The Pecan Pie tasted like a basic run of the mill store bought pie.  It was probably the largest portion of the night...The service was inconsistent.  We received our first 2 courses in a reasonable amount of time but we rarely saw our server in between.  Our dessert was the longest wait of the night by far...I wouldn't make it a point to come back because I don't think this was worth the money.  It's Red Lobster food at premium prices.
azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,1y2dLZg2l3dtLc1nzU2qzg,ZQ0P8h_3y_PRiqPTB5qKjQ,4.0,Pricey but excellent upscale Sushi restaurant in The Mirage. This is a great place to take that special someone you might be traveling with in Las Vegas...They've got adventurous and interesting rolls; as well as high quality versions of go-to standbys like Spicy Tuna and California Rolls. Their cocktail list is excellent as well; with their standout drink being the Floating Orchid; which features a real and edible... floating orchid. Romantic and hip; I haven't been in a couple years but look forward to dining there again on my next trip out to Vegas.

Tonight the service was incredibly slow and the waitress was not attentive. They didn't appear overly busy or short staffed so the service really should have been better

Every time my husband and I have gone to this restaurant; we've enjoyed the experience.  The staff tries hard to accommodate diners in every way.  We were attending a show uptown on a Friday evening and came in for a last-minute dinner with no reservation.  Not only did the staff manage to fit us in; they served us immediately; as we requested. My husband loves the boar there and the tenderloin. Everything we've eaten there is good.  Frequently features live jazz.  Very close to Belk Theater and other uptown attractions...will validate parking.

B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA,xuv-8Qedv_CMDV8mbd0vTw,JcHS-P7Pw7mbrtGXaR1YYA,1.0,Ate here for valentine's day with a prix fixe menu. WHAT A RIP OFF! $69/person + $20/person for wine pairings... Not including a 21% automatic gratuity for HORRIBLE SLUG-LIKE service!!! The waitress was super chatty and nosey when I was trying to have a romantic dinner with my girlfriend. The owner went to every table EXCEPT for ours to greet and make sure everyone was satisfied; although i did catch her looking at our table twice... Is everyone in arizona racist against Asians or something? ..Pot pie came out with FORKS instead of spoons.... huh?! The wrong second course was brought to our table... And we waited 20 minutes to have our water refilled. Seriously?!..Food: The owner should be embarrassed! The menu was entirely new with courses they've never tested out beforehand... And it all sucked!!!! Prawns and scallops were raw... At least sear the dang thing; the last time I checked I was at a French restaurant; not out having sushi. Oyster pot pie was disgusting... Might as well have gone to Marie calendar's for that. Petite filet was decently flavored; but a bit dry. Dessert was pathetic- you would THINK a nutella apricot upside down cake would be mouth wateringly delicious; but surprise!!!!!! It was a dry flippin cake with burnt nutella on top. Betty Crocker; please teach the chefs at Petite Maison a thing or two -_- ..I really wanted to try the infamous foie gras there since its been banned in california; but I'm so glad I didn't. It would've probably ruined my love for foie gras forever; just like this restaurant ruined what WAS a perfectly good valentine's day. ..Merci Petite Maison............... for the worst experience ever!
KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ,eCcawIMRS3ShFnkqb0W05w,8ozxx6Uc7MXoh4tiOF6rqA,4.0,My wife and I have visited Rao's several times and were pleased again with what we had. It always seems to be a struggle getting a table here although I am not sure how happy they are just to seat two people who want to dine without a reservation. For the first time we were seated on the patio which was fine although our server was a little slow and not so attentive. The Caprese salad appetizer was good (great fresh mozzarella) although the tomato's werent too tasty. The pasta dishes we both had were very good and once our server found out we were locals; he managed to deliver a special desert on the house as it was our anniversary. A nice way to finish a pretty good meal.
ToHKLIjR05Rz9boWvmWaPA,RylA6VZUTRuMGBu4nHKbCw,KfQyGBxyPBFEjWk9CwpL-Q,3.0,It took a bit of time to get started bowling because the cashier wasn't able to work her computer terminal with any level of competency. It took her the assistance of another person and quite some time to just to split the lane fee up evenly between a few credit cards. She said she was newer; but you'd think how to accept payment would be high on the list of training skills. ..I had a fun bowling experience; but that was really because of my friends and not because of any effort on the part of Corner Alley. We had lane #5 which allows for a bit extra space by the lane because between lane 4 and 5 is dead space / ceiling columns. The same happens between 8 and 9 so I would recommend choosing those lanes if the place is busy.  ..There was a menu lying around by the lane and soon after getting started with the game a waitress came over to take F&B orders. We got a beer pitcher and the garlic parm fries; which I thought were good and not too oily.  ..The service was good; but just bare bones - nothing above and beyond. The server didn't offer drink refills which was a bit odd as we bowled for two hours and all the glasses and pitcher were empty before that point. She even provided the check before seeing if another pitcher was wanted. When she brought over the fries she didn't ask if any condiments were wanted and when one person in our group requested a water; she didn't ask if anyone else wanted one. Just little things like that were missed that could have made a difference in opinion and actually could have caused us to spend more money. ..I have to say since the redesign of the space Corner Alley is much more attractive and welcoming from the exterior; but the bowling lanes are quite bright with all the windows now. The atmosphere was vary spacious and there were a lot of TVs; some located above the pins at the end of each lane. The audio in the space was coming from a TV playing a live local sports game. I only noticed this really because the commercials were piped through the lanes at full volume. That just seemed odd to me. I would probably have the TVs on silent; except at the bar; and have music by the lanes. The Sunday bowling crowd consisted of a few groups with children; not big groups seemingly into sports.  ..I went on a Sunday before 5p so the hourly lane rate was $27 with tax. Shoes are $3.50 for however many hours you bowl. The prices vary by day and time so check the website for that info...Assigning a star value to this place is hard because there are so many aspects to it. I would without a doubt come here to bowl again; but I would choose Corner Alley to bowl; not for any other reason. And my expectations would not be really much higher than they are for any other; decade older local alley.
ESinwiCgoJNG-tMWxVQhqQ,2AZaPPRAWhDDO7k-jlpfwg,wtcz7I1q2zy6o9Laz3g9kw,2.0,Pallets needs a bit of work. The decor is fun; but I could've done without MMA on the TV. That said; the service was fine;"
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,FWvAdvaQx02yZKdvr8HpLQ,6ksL9HpuhWGAFxR0iDS7aQ,4,The hosts at the front door had no idea how long it would be for a wait and were too busy chatting amongst themselves to really entertain the idea to sit us. Once we were in however the good was great and the beer selection is unreal. ..We sat at the bar which over looked the appetizer chefs. Wow they are sure composed and made us feel confident of the level of professionalism that we would come to expect from the kitchen. ..Also had a good live band. If they figured out the hosting and had them actually do what is expected I would have given it a 5 star experience.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,5G1LLdZNxwswR1TjMfiMig,TK7L9pTWu4mrwOdxfXh-ew,5,The motto of the Bier Markt is bier is beautiful; and we could not say it any better. This week we were granted the incredible opportunity to sample the libations housed at the Bier Markt and boy did we sample them. Boasting an inventory of over 150 biers from 30 countries; there is certainly a choice for every taste and every budget including a $60 bottle of Westvleteren. The drink menu has over thirty pages of choices; but to be fair the last few pages are non-bier options such as cocktails and wines. However as this is a bier mecca; don't be surprised when your cocktail is made with bier. To the best of our knowledge there is no bier in the wine...The Montreal location is on Rene Levesque Blvd one block away from the home of the Habs; the Bell Centre.  With three floors available for dinning; there is room for everyone; before; during and after the game. Looking for some music; you can find a cover band every Thursday evening and a live DJ on Friday and Saturday. The main floor of the restaurant has a very casual flair. With bistro tables and stools it is easy to move about from table to table;  it is a welcoming area and great for casual dining or just a few glasses of bier. The upper two floors are designated as more formal dining areas; and can accommodate any size party. There is also a private room available for lunch meetings or celebrations. If you need something special; just contact Lawrence or David and they will be happy to make your event unique and of course full of bier...We were invited to sample a lunch menu and were served by the amazing Max. If every server is as attentive as Max; you can be sure you will be well taken care of. Our meal started with the make your own charcuterie board; with the choice of two meats and one cheese. Larger boards are available for groups or you can choose a pre-designed board. As with everything on the menu; there is a bier pairing suggestion. We were presented with a glass of Stiegl lager; and it complemented the smokeyness of the cheese perfectly...For round two we were served a candied bacon poutine. It was described to us as a dream poutine; and it was a dream to eat it. Along side the dish was a healthy portion of dunkle duck wings. Dry-spiced with a rub the wings are served with two types of dipping sauce; but were also delicious all on their own. The accompanying bier was the Goose Island Honker's Ale. Alternating sips with bites of food; the combination of spices and the ale brought forward flavours we had never before experienced...Next came the Angus beef tartar. If you are a fan of tartar; this classic fare will not disappoint. With the beef on the bottom; a layer of toasted baguette slices and topped with greens; this dish was prepared to perfection. How do you top perfection but add the perfect pairing. This time it was the triple brewed Tripel Karmellet Ale. The caramel taste of the bier only made the tartar taste even better...Finally we ended our meal with both dessert and of course another bier. For dessert; a bag of fresh and tasty sugared doughnuts with a coffee English cream dip for what else but dipping. You may not think that bier would go well with sugared doughnuts and were we surprised at how well the glass of Grimbergen Dubbel Abby Ale did. This strong dark ale; gave the doughnuts a completely new taste...We thoroughly enjoyed the food; the bier and the service at the Bier Markt. We have decided that the motto is right Bier is Beautiful and we loved every drop of it.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,60v7H_m0Atd_98oCwqclew,PG6uJXg1Jfr8b-td3lSWdQ,4,Been here several times and enjoyed my experience each time. The wait staff were very attentive and friendly. I tried a few things on the menu; was decent but no wow factor. Nice ambiance; live bands; great beer; and love their oyster specials.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,2av488ePvb-Z4qgeNDpWCg,BSYG47ftdC1r2Jz6aKAfXw,2,I would really really like to give this place more than 2 stars...The location is great and I'd love for this to be our go-to restaurant before a show - avoiding overpriced and terrible ribs served a few steps away from there. Perfect spot for after work drinks with groups or a quick eat before a hockey game - I wouldn't say it's a date-night restaurant...Although my evening started off with a great note; perfect greeting and awesome recos for beer choices by our waiter; the rest was quite a bummer. I ordered the mussels from their vast and appealing menu; thinking this would be a sure bet. ..But the mussels were not cooked enough. Some were still fishy; too soft; and many had not had time to open. I also believe that the loads of garlic and onions that were thrown in there were raw. Raw garlic and onions; really? Basically; the entire thing just wasn't cooked! ..Moreover; service quickly became overwhelmed and disorganized; and we just lost our server.....I will say I appreciated that they did not charge me for the mussels I did not eat; and the rest of the dishes looked delish - burgers; salads; poutines... So I will probably be giving this place a second chance; but I definitely won't be ordering mussels !!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,hCdpFe7BZ4U8FXC9BHFx8w,3,Aside from the usual 1$ oysters I tried the burgers here -the Markt burger was pretty good with one patty and goat cheese instead of a second patty; I enjoyed the portion as it wasn't enormous and the side of of poutine (3$ extra)filled me up nicely. I had a beer flight with it for 14$; an assortment of blondes and stout-was a good choice for share between friends.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,b_qTbNB2DZ71jRQ3Ikph6Q,0SFRe0VYlTVmT9gVoSG5oQ,5,I reserved a table Friday night at 9:30 pm for 10:30 the same night.   I'm so glad I did.  It gets busy after the Bell centre lets out.  The food was excellent and so was the live music.  The place has a great vibe.  We will be back for sure.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,HbZ0FQXIVuMAaRyLBOokdg,3,They have a nice big location downtown with lots of room inside. The decor and ambience inside is casual. 1$ oysters were great!  They were very fresh and were a nice size (Ask for their special Lingonberry hot sauce to go with them!). Our waiter was super pleasant and on point with service/suggestions. However; my main course was just okay ; I had a grilled chicken burger with house salad. The portion was perfect since it wasn't too much food but enough to be filling. However; quality wise the salad was alright ; it was fresh but very basic and the chicken burger was lacking flavor and was on the cusp of undercooked. For the price I expected a little better to be honest. Overall ; I would come back for the oysters and for some beer but may choose another option for food as the dish I chose wasn't anything special.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,85Jq6l707HWj2XpFw7qPGg,fN5fX-FUCyHDKZkdHfBGwQ,4,La bouffe boff...peut-être car nous étions plus que vingt que toutes les frites étaient froides? Bref; nous n'avons pas tripper sur la bouffe.....Par contre; niveau ambiance; choix de bière et service...rien à dire...endroit magnifique :)
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,5OjhTcVQ1NNUlBm9Fef-pg,9sCkHO4wdc7cVQlP3EzNUg,5,A lovely place; with great food. But beers are phenomenal -in particular local brewed beers (Tracteur; fin du monde....). Strongly recommended!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,raqwXMIO8YrfHgxPWbBNrQ,8Vcd3OH0m0_2NLvRCxQoCQ,1,I am a local from Montreal. Some people say the poutine is amazing... I was with a bunch of people who chose this and it is NOT good. They were all disappointed. Go to la Banquise instead. I had a burger and it was not cooked inside. Service was very long and the waitress was completely lost in the orders. Go to  Hurley's; McKibbins or Old yer Orchard instead of paying too much for lower quality food and service.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,AX7PN-tAH5vUO5KRbKEVZQ,i4vYEjrVuL1bBDRRQAE48A,3,Comme son nom l'indique l'endroit est spécialisé dans la bière avec un large choix de bière du monde entier; Certaines en fût alors que la plupart se trouve en bouteilles...Le choix est intéressant et la cartes précise mais les prix ne sont pas donnés. Il en est de même pour ce qui est de l'alimentation. J'étais content d'être invité car 20€ le burger c'est pas donné il était bon mais j'ai connu mieux pour moins cher. ..Le cadre est sympa et vu le nombre d'écrans je pense que c'est un bon endroit pour aller voir un match et passer une soirée entre amis.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,gRRaQoC9TF_CiPABk3XOBw,J9_4X4P3wbfJXqMVM8hSMw,5,I don't understand Montrealers automatic assumption that any restaurant that is part of a chain must be inherently bad. ..Montrealers are just not used to chains from away coming to town. Few do as Quebec laws and society make it so difficult to do business here. ..Yes this is part of a Toronto based chain. So what?..It happens to be a successful chain (hence the expansion). ..Montrealers should be glad to have an expanded choice of places to eat and fill the void between the over the top pretentiousness and trendiness of the likes of Toqué and au pied de cochon; and la belle province and schwartz's. ..This is a well crafted concept with a fantastic menu and an amazing beer list. They are passionate about their food and beer and the service is pretty good too. ..Don't like it don't go there but don't criticise them for doing something different if they do it well. ..I have been a fan of the Biermarkt since I first encountered them in Toronto. ..I even tried to work for them. That didn't work out but I still love the atmosphere; menu and service. The Montreal location is ideal. In the old queue de cheval building they have turned down the pretentiousness of the old decor with their take on warm European pub/brauhaus chic. ..As ever the menu is an inspired and tasty nod to basic European staples like moules frites and schnitzel both pork and veal. ..I had the bavette with fries cooked a perfect medium rare. Ask for a side of curry Mayo with your frites. ..Our server Daphne was attentive and friendly. ..The only negative I could find was the spider webs on the column above our table beautifully spotlighted by the light over the table. Time to follow up with the cleaning crew about high dusting! ..Definitely a great addition to downtown dining. ..Will be back. ..Cheers!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,G1QG6IfLuE5uirU6PMo2dA,q1wC-SNeKXok0NJPq8O9Yw,3,It's not a bad place but it's not somewhere I'd willingly go. I had a sangria and an order of steak with a blue cheese topping. The side of fingerling potatoes were delish and so was the sangria. The steak was disappointing. ..It was a Saturday night so after 11 there was old school hip hop and r&b music playing pretty loud which made the atmosphere more enjoyable but not enough to make us want to stay longer.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,ecf4jpZh6VY_rUyyKtW6JQ,wwHbo9kB_Ncmby7oFh0r8g,1,Food is absolutely not up to par for Montreal. Service is horrible. Been waiting 25 min already for our bill! Skip this place
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,hW2oVv5VCrnVWstUWBdvNw,A00u4QsoD3MnzzFi3idlbw,1,This is a bit tough to review because for the most part I enjoyed myself at Bier Markt; until later that evening when I got sick.   Unfortunately food poisoning is an automatic 1 star in my books. ..First the good.   The building is very nice. Its a new construction with a very classy retro interior; although their enthusiasm for all things Belgian is over the top (more on that later). We were seated on the second floor near the staircase.   They have 150 different types of beer; 30 or so on tap and the menu is really good about explaining the beers and providing food pairing suggestions.   A great place for those of us who support beer getting the same love as wine or scotch.   Our server was also very friendly and helpful; and food was delivered in a timely matter (too timely as it turned out).  We started by sharing a short rib Poutine that was excellent and for a main my girlfriend had a flammekouch (a pizza esque creation) that she said was excellent.   I went for the very Belgian moules frites in a white wine and shallot sauce.  Very promising...Now the bad.  When I mentioned the food came too quick; it was because quite a few of the mussels were undercooked.   I am not a mussel connoisseur and I already had a couple of beers in me so I didn't really notice at first; I thought they were just really fresh.  When my girlfriend tried a couple she noticed the undercookedness; by which point it was too late.  Fortunately I have a tough stomach but two days later I am still feeling a bit nauseated.  It happens that sometimes a couple of mussels are not cooked but to have almost half of them is no good.  One last comment is that they are disturbingly enthusiastic about the peeing boy statue.  There is a giant replica on the front of the place and another overlooking the stairs; which have the statue pointed over your head; a tad creepy...Its too bad that my experience ended the way it did because this place actually is pretty good; just avoid the mussels.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,UjSniC2yqEWAHmhz31t2lQ,3,Went here for a CrackBerry meetup. It was my first time here but I often did walk by the place but never went in...The CrackBerry event included an alcohol/beer so I had one of their beers. I'm not a real beer drinker which is why I've never gone to this place. I will have the occasional beer if I'm with friends and they order a beer or if I go to a pub or if I'm offered a drink while playing in the casino. The event also included some small appetizers (finger food)...Since I had just finished work before showing up to the event; I decided to order something to eat. I decided to go with the poutine. I found the portion size of the poutine to be small for the price (it was roughly the size of a McDonald's poutine) and with my bacon add-on was $10+taxes+tip. Between the 2 beers that I had and the poutine (along with the free small finger food appetizers); I felt satisfied (although not stuffed)...I found it to be very loud in the place and could hardly hear myself talk or hear my colleague talk. I didn't have any problems with the service and the staff serving the beer as well as the server who took my poutine order and the person who brought me my order were all friendly. They have free WiFi here but required signing in with an e-mail address so I just opted to use the data on my cellphone...I wouldn't have an issue coming back here especially to try the oysters deal advertised.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,BnWnD8zpYzRNqGA9wUiZdA,jzA2oYuKB-_Rfrr4qpLoSg,3,They have a great beer selection although the vast majority of them cost around 20 dollars a bottle. Despite that they do have some very cool beers at reasonable prices like roddenbach grand cru and frampton brasse nuit d'automne..The food is good but pricey. The service is hit or miss some great waiters and some boderline rude waiters..Not a great place to watch sports as low hanging lamps block the tvs.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,HFWzgGHkcyowUSRkJrMf_A,ZY1VGTSfFg6-5FjJqI0ICA,3,Great outgoing staff and good service. Large portions. The food is decent. Bacon poutine was a bit disappointing; but the onion rings were amazing. I would recommend this place if you're not in a hurry as it took about 40 minutes for food to come out.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,BO3Q8Y_pkveKzRym2ExKVw,dpUuSH1aGWNE2kqPag29fA,5,This was one of the best finds while in Montreal. I was with some friend and we were going to watch hockey at the Bell Centre; but wanted to get a few beers before the game. BM looks like a chain restaurant from the outside; but the food is really good quality and service is top notch. I suggest sitting on the first level either at the bar or in the back by the grill...We went twice in one day and the service was awesome both times. Get the charcuterie! I highly recommend the Serrano Ham; pate; and potted chicken liver mousse. ..They have a tremendous selection of beer. It seems like you really can't go wrong! There's an awesome tripel for only $5 although I can't remember the name. It's 9% alcohol. Ask for it.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,1652MDlbA0pOtsq7U1Ygow,JpAXmcQioLx5NvoqfhRy9w,3,Great selection of beer; convenient downtown location; ample seating; what's not to love right? Well; a few things. I teeter-tottered between two and three stars for Bier Markt for awhile. Ultimately; it arrives at three because I'll go back.  ..The Good:..Great beer selection; Plenty of taps; plenty of bottle choices; great menu for those not familiar. Also; they even do beer pairing recommendations! The menu; is well rounded; and has great lunch choices. The ambiance is fantastic. On paper; this is a great lunch spot. A nice touch is the correct use of appropriate glasses for the various styles of beer. Good prices on most things in bottle. Free coat check during winter...The Bad:..Consistency and speed. Lunch rushes are always hard on a new establishment; and it shows. Unlike it's Ontario brethren; the kitchen was slow. Being seated at the bar; the bar tender was attentive; friendly; warm. Much to offset the nearly 35-45 minute wait for anything coming out of the kitchen; Alas; when over half an hour had passed without seeing a french fry; I inquired; and was informed it was typical for 40+ minute waits for the kitchen. 40 minutes? Downtown? For lunch? Eek; for a place perfect to catering to the businessman lunch; that hour is a hard time constraint.  As to consistency; personally my fries we're perfect; my burger over cooked (I'm not a fan of well-done); my companion however received under-seasoned fries; but a nice medium burger.  I'll chalk this up to a kitchen that's behind; and that to being young. Given the wait; result; and price; it's disappointing. ..TL;DR; Issues; Pricey;  but the beer selection and prospect of greatness will make me revisit Bier Markt; and this review in the future. Skip it for now if you're trying to get in an hour lunch break; or get there early.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,_C64bivRbIUpOgP69qvNyw,_GahZpEiDxehSUPtUxrRTA,1,The service was bad I went on Monday and I know the burger are on special and I ask if any special and they said no and tell her ;I have a app they said burger on special and she said ooo yes ;really    Bad
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,3ZrY316WfsTrFKbUCc9waw,UM8LkM-chmNzl2_KnQR4Qg,4,Couldn't wait to try this place considering my husband is a self professed beer snob; and I'm such a foodie! .Set off to explore . Made 8:30 reservations and glad I did. Packed house.  On a  Sunday night to boot!.Walked in at  8:28 and our table was ready..They advertise 130 beers from over 30 countries! I was thinking wow. Thank god we walked to this place cause this might be dangerous!  .Unfortunately they only offer 3 types of fixed flights.  A European; and Canadian & a IPA mix.  Too bad you couldn't mix and match.  They did have about 30 Taps.  The rest bottles or cans.  He ordered a Rochefort 10 it's a Belgian quadruple .  14.00 a bottle; and he said it was worth it.  He also had the Canadian flight special at 15.00.I had a Ceaser cocktail.  A version of a Bloody Mary but even better.  It was so good.  Real good.  Wish I could take 3 to go!! Only 9.00 and it's a free appetizer to boot!  It had dried sausage pickles smoked Gouda candied bacon on a skewer.  Absolutely delicious! .We decided on the 50 ounce Tomahawk!  Comes with bone marrow; fingerling potatoes; baby bok choy and FF's.  Since it came  with potatoes already I asked if we could skip the ff's and get a salad.  She said fine.  But I was charged 7.00 for lettuce with no dressing.  Not a big deal but 7.00? $ 99.00 for a dinner for two; and  7.00 for lettuce is crazy.  That aside; it was good. Ordered it medium rare; came out medium.  Didn't say anything;  cause you can't change medium.  I figured in my head; it's not 99.00 to me; since the US dollar is strong here; so I let it go.  Trust me if it was back home; that steak would have gone back!! .Service was good.  Our waitress was so sweet.  The place  had a upscale feel to it even though it had TV's neatly displayed all over.  Overall the beer added the extra star to the 3 star food rating making this  a 4 star review!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,amvbUBB9368Cf-7SnxtPTg,D7x1xj_WG2De7EJWPxtGcQ,4,We arrived at Bier Markt on October 9th; 2015 at 7 pm. Ordered calamari; duck wings and 2 orders of 2 different flavor mussels. Everything came fast. Calamari and duck wings were good. Mussels were undercooked. We asked to send it back to kitchen to get them cooked some more. The kitchen replaced our two orders of mussels with new ones and cooked them well this time. Our waiter was quick and courteous. .The beer was very good . Overall we enjoyed.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,w9-MFxIORCIttQGyllxKyQ,-1rZscISWb2ZiHaQwlJoDw,4,Went for a quick lunch during a busy day! Good service..I took the Schnitzel sandwich-gauffre that was excellent!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,vPsATIRaGZUOzXLZ5UqhNA,D7qBWT1SDrBq11VtAgktkQ,1,Warm beer and need to change their fryer oil. Great selection of beer; but not cold enough. ..Anything deep fried tasted bad due to oil fryer oil...Add to the list weak pours. See photo for a full pour
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,A5h17ouvgl4URu1jhYocXQ,Zo_k66rwgYWJ1hTrT4Hsgg,2,C'est après avoir fait 3 pubs avec des files d'attente (tout à fait normal lors de la St-Patrick; je sais haha) qu'on a décidé d'aller au Bier Markt... finalement l'attente aurait value la peine!..Pour au moins se mettre un peu dans l'ambiance de la fête; nous avons commandé une Guinness. Malheureusement celle-ci goûtait l'eau... bon commencement haha..Nous avons ensuite commandé chacune une pizza. J'ai choisi la pizza poulet fumé et pesto et mon amie a choisi celle aux saucisses épicées. .Ma pizza était correcte; mais lorsque mon amie a commencé à s'étouffer avec un cheveux qui avait clairement cuit dans sa pizza et pas seulement juste tombé sur le dessus; ma pizza ne semblait plus autant bonne lol je précise que mon amie avait les cheveux attachés; donc ce n'était pas le sien ..La manager est venu nous voir et nous dire que la pizza ne serait pas chargé (thank god) et qu'elle pouvait prendre ce qu'elle voulait sur le menu. Elle a choisi les frites de patates douces. Selon elle c'était correct...Nous avons eu du mal tout au long de la soirée avec le service. Notre serveuse était absente et essayer de capter son attention était devenu un petit jeu pour nous...Bref; il y a tellement plus de bons restos au centre-ville... je ne crois pas y retourner.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,xzSz6QH-zl46dYISWEogFA,5V4mV2KKkmV8PRW_PtH93w,4,Get. the. Poutine. flight. It is absolutely delicious! I'm not a big beer drinker so I did not try any of the ales but the poutine and salads are pretty good!! Also if you come on a Friday night; there will be a live band playing.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,jBPAGstSF_NDVoATYvXNAA,CqEi_bEcXadzOy6KF0A7yQ,4,My wife and I recently visited this place while spending a week in Montreal. We loved it - took beer sampler and tried different brews of beers. They also have a great Poutine - gooey french fries full of cheesy and bacon goodness.  Probably loaded with calories; but oh; was it good... They pronounce it over there as [poot'seen].  A must-try ... at least we loved it. It is fairly expensive; and we had to wait longer than we would expect.  However it did not appear to be a systematic thing - there was a huge group which kept our waitress on her toes.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,kubJ9q0g1L4IqjVCqyTtFw,JZmeXZ5zm3ePDpFOMn1HOA,4,The beer is kind of whatever; and typical of pretty much all bars of this sort.  Acceptable but nothing special...The food was above average with pretty good spins on American classics. The steak cut calamari was just grilled without breading; served cold with a drizzle of lemon on a lettuce leafs. It was a simple but effective prep; perfect with the poutine. ..The wings were good.  Drummed sticks trimmed to lollipops then served with buffalo sauce (and something else that tasted sweeter).  Perfectly fried and the buffalo sauce was spot on.  A lot healthier too because wings weren't drenched in the sauce...Crunchy Brussels sprout leaves worked well. A little greasy but that ended up working really well with the citrus on the calamari.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,IcNZCLcESX62-44HsnurDA,O3uGdpI9hhQik5NAWPTHzA,3,Overall; a decent venue. Beer selection is fantastic; food & service are average. Prices are a bit high. Good atmosphere/energy to be in before a hockey game...We started with Poutine Tour which was tasty/fun; then had the Bouillabaisse and the Merchant (Wagyu Beef) Burger. The Bouillabaisse was missing some of the ingredients they had listed on the menu; though the flavour was good enough. The burger was served medium rare; which was pretty underdone for our taste; and we weren't advised that it would not be cooked through when we placed our order.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,Y9uJlgOPCCiGh-vmrctMjQ,3bjesHMH208hib-DNtRTRw,3,Do not eat here...This place is for beer drinking only. The beer is good and the 1 litre glass is $10. The ambiance; decor are good for a sports bar. The high chairs start to get annoying/uncomfortable after awhile...Avoid their burgers like the plague. The burgers are burnt (both the meat and the bread) and bland. Afterwards; I spent a better part of the night trying to get rid of the nasty aftertaste. The price for the burger was outrageous-$20 for a nasty burger and small sweet potato fries...Go to watch the game/hang out with friends and drink beer; but don't eat there!

JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,XuIEKbGEhr0tcy4pU0kBPg,3,Came here for a guys night dinner before the boys hit the town. This was previously Cueue de Cheval and I always wondered what it was like inside as I never ate at CDC after hearing it was quite overpriced for what you received. The place is quite large with two levels and lots of TV's. We were seated at a big table at the left rear corner of the restaurant. It was a busy Saturday evening and the restaurant was alive. ..Beer selection is quite large and hence there is a book of many beers available on tap. For the beer lovers it's fantastic. ..Onto the food. I had selected bier can chicken and spätzle soup. It was extremely salty but I still barely ate it. To the point of it being overkill. This is coming from someone who enjoys Asian food which is typically a bit higher in sodium content. I should have mentioned something to the server but was never asked how it was. ..For my main I had the big pot of mussels and fries. Which was delicious. Mussels were very fresh plump and the broth served was slightly salty but highly tasty. Fries were crisp; generous serving and went down the hatch no problem. This brought the meal back. ..My friends all ordered various dishes: charcuterie; the bratwurst board; steak; short rib; one ordered a burger. All were pleasantly pleased. From their reaction I'd say all of them enjoyed their meals were they blown away? I'd rank it as a 3.5/5 for a chain restaurant. Keep in mind pricing is medium high. Overall 3.5 I'd say is a fair rating. If you like beer and hearty man food it's your place!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,CWEqxefSdpOVwKUkAnEthQ,1,The place is nice. Service is fast and friendly...But the food..... Bad!!!! ..We had calamari; very chewy and some of the rings had white freezer burn. Bland and tasteless. We were 3 and we didn't finish the plate...Then we all took the 25$ burger. Epic failure. Meat was bland and certainly not wagyu as stated in the menu. Bacon was only fat. It was so flabby and undercooked that all 3 of us removed it from the burger entirely. ..The only thing that was ok was the fries. ..One comment I have for the staff is to ask the customer if something was wrong when they see half eaten burgers and slabs of bacon on the plates when they clear the table.

JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,cqgjW23FJyu5kFlRDN1CpQ,uTPZcJJyZm1bcbekARdzYA,4,Came in after a terrible Habs vs. Rangers loss; it's right across the street and super convenient. It is spacious and accommodating; the beer options are endless; which at times can get a little nerve-wrecking. The food was delicious; my friend and I ordered a few appetizers to share. Between the chicken wings; smoked meat poutine; and mini burgers; the first two were a hit and totally memorable! Now; on to the beers; what I really enjoyed was the 20$ beer tasting options. You can choose from European; Quebecois; and IPA; and you'll get 6 assorted beers with an indicator of where to start. It's a pretty great deal; I had the European and IPA; and enjoyed them thoroughly.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,6GN1-lN562HbUOBN51AeYQ,E8i56IzMNkHrBXUxj0l11w,5,Choix de bière plus qu'appreciable! Certaines importations de leur carte sont difficiles à trouver à Montréal (je pense à la Youngs Double Chocolate par exemple); j'ai donc été agréablement surpris. ..C'est parfois difficile de tomber sur une seule Hefeweizen dans un bar; ils en ont quelques variétés. Je n'ai pas essayé la nourriture encore; mais je ferai une mise à jour quand ce sera fait: bientôt. Personnel accueillant qui connaît son produit.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,-9b4s874f_CnznTu4JorRg,KWPDD2xtjIYiLw3fFGmETA,4,J'ai vraiment apprécié cette place; nous avions fait une réservation et nous avions un superbe endroit dans un coin au second étage. ..Le service a été magnifique; notre serveuse était super attentionné et à l'écoute ce qui à fait le plus grand plaisir de notre tablé de quinze personne. ..Le décor est également sympathique; beaucoup de bois comme un pub classique mais avec un petit air classy grave à la décoration; ceci dis on a vraiment l'ambiance pub avec les multiples TVs et la place était bondé...Pour finir la nourriture; j'ai pris le burger veggie avec champignon portobello accompagné de frites classique; le burger était bon et les frites aussi mais rien de particulièrement extraordinaire. J'ai aussi pu goûter leur rondelles d'oignon et leur pretzel; puis boy que c'était bon. Ils avait aussi un special huître à 1$; ce qui vaut le détour si tu aimes les huîtres.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,hAiso8IQfKW88uWUGDI51g,x_VNYTNntA97QFCya2RlJg,4,Food 3.5/5 Decor 4/5 Ambiance 4/5 Staff&Service 3/5.First of all; I have to say I don't like beer; so if you are like me and think it's only a place to drink beer you are wrong. The cocktails are really great plus they have a full bar so they can make you whatever you wish. The food is good every time I've been; the last meal I had was the ahi tuna. It was perfectly seared and the potatoes and greens were delicious. I also had the bavarian pretzels which were also unexpectedly large with just the right amount of salt on them; and the hot-mustard sauce went very well with it too! However I have to say I'm on the fence for this review because I've visited BierMarkt three times now and the service has been hit or miss. I either got a cheery waitress that smiled and giggled at everything I said; or an irritated waitress that just answers 'I don't know' when you ask her a question about the menu and looks at you as if she expects you to simply choose something else instead of offering to check with the kitchen/bartender. But this might have just been a fluke.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,LPRXNAx_twMXs00Zpa8tbQ,QiDV9Yj5PWmFqdFXH1wmFg,3,The food was fantastic. However; the service wasn't great. Our waiter was great when we came in to explain the concept of the beer pairings but after we ordered and our food came we didn't see him again until we were done.  Granted it was a busy night but we never got refills of anything. But the food was fantastic. I would go back.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,PNSPNmEp_ro9tX6AuLBwBA,1IuqyyTxgoXrKcZ51BZLfQ,3,This place is convenient for me because it's close to where I live...The theee stars are bc of the service which is acceptable. Nothing more. .. I had the duck wings there with a pint white beer and was very satisfied with what I had. I just found out about their $1 oyster deal during the week so I'll definitely be back to try it out!
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,O23t_OwlPE8AWC-mH3CFww,TlddZJHJFoAM_mqxW5614g,5,Awesome place. Came here after dropping off our bags in our hotel nearby. Everything was delicious and our bar tender/waitress was so nice. It was a great introduction to Montreal. We ordered some beers; I got a local IPA and it was really good. We also ordered a cheese dip which was good and had maybe some roasted reds on top of it. Also we ordered the amazing duck wings; which are served with a mustard based sauce and a lingonberry BBQ sauce. Those were some of the best wings I've ever had! Overall; definitely the type of place that breeds loyalty. We wi be back before we leave the city. Excellent; huge beer selection; excellent food.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,6eYecZI0cGbSdVP33PawDA,BKYYkBo6UfibS6u2g5GtNg,3,Pretty good place; great location; over 150 different beers!!!!.We were a large group unfortunately things were disorganized people were done eating the pork while others had not been served. I received my soup after I was done eating main course. I ordered dessert and never received it and it took over 20 min to get a beer you ordered....It's a nice experience but cost around 115$ for 2 beers; main course and a soup so the value was not really there for that amount. I am going back for lunch next week hopefully the a la carte menu is better
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,rSmzJWksglpkxZjen9KgGw,qRLeHCm0eSZSEcWAlcvvNQ,5,150 beers available is almost worth 5 stars on its own. The well done and laid out beer menu is almost worth 5 stars (well done to the owners on that one!!) .The food was above average as well. This will be on my must stop again list for sure.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,JioDny5J43jT_htsjW8BKA,U6O7f6mwTXuCAfDUK-a49w,5,On a cold winters night vacation from California; we yelped IPA'sand came upon this place. What a wonderful surprise. That bartender was so sweet and the IPA amazing and the cheeses and smoked meets we're outstanding. Would definitely return whenever we come back to Montreal.
JgKpVoemZ-Khkfgif5V7qQ,MZyMY-nW2ChwIs7ZhELOTQ,S53C8YswIX48pTGWNxLsow,5,Spent 4 nights in Montreal this past week and went here for 3 of those nights and experienced all the different aspects of this place...First visit was on Tue night; both right before and after the Canadiens game. Place was packed before the game and we only grabbed a couple beers before heading off to the Bell Centre; but then returned afterwards for a couple more and to eat. Although the late night menu only really consisted off a handful of things; the burger was fortunately one of them and incredibly delicious (even if pricey at $25). ..Second night we only came in for a couple drinks after dinner; and noticed a small jazz group just wrapping up on a small stage on the main floor .Third night we had a group dinner up on the 3rd floor where we got to sample the real menu; which was pretty incredible. Don't think anyone ordered anything they didn't like (I had the salmon) and we joked we may call in 48 hrs in advance next time we're here to try the roasted pig...All in all; beer selection was excellent. Mostly Canadian and European offerings with around 30 different draft offerings and a ton more bottles. Service was quite good for a place that's constantly busy; and as I mentioned before; the food was well above par for a place that's essentially a glorified brewpub. No doubt I'll be back next month when I'm in Montreal again.

jJALMyBDfqOjzuuQAooDtw,qxGhFRq9XZhAQbmt6cOLzA,yyC61GkYbsdgXGT0dJ4-EQ,5,Beautiful; delicious; fresh and not expensive. They give several steps forward in the creativity of their dishes. If you go at lunchtime; try the Orchid salad. Fantastic! The only issue is location and the not updated decor. I use to lunch there a lot and it always great.
jJALMyBDfqOjzuuQAooDtw,KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,vXE3lxlSDsdqDEKTo3qLxA,3,I was surprised how busy this resto was on a Tuesday night. I went because I was in the area and the reviews on yelp were good. ..I ordered the lobster sushi roll which contained grilled lobster; avocado; cucumber; caviar; crab stick and dill mayo. It was a bit on the chewy side but I did love the fact that they put dill in the sushi. This is off their sushi menu. ..Then came tropical sushi (8pcs). I ordered it because it had no rice and the waitress recommended it. I don't think I've ever had sushi without rice before this. It was good. Especially for those who want to cut down on carbs. It contained spicy crabmeat; cucumber; avocado; caviar; pineapple; spring mix and tempura with a choice of tartare (scallop; tuna or salmon). I chose salmon. Out of the two rolls I  preferred this one. It was on their specialty menu. ..These two rolls filled me up. Honestly it wasn't the best sushi. I don't think I would come back.
jJALMyBDfqOjzuuQAooDtw,yOVFRBi1xFuAFHsyzqc_hQ,PrD8hOiBl7VFd1u5p7Idlg,1,This is the worse sushi place I've ever visited. I was in this place a year ago; and the sushi was horrible while the prices were expensive (~$7 for a roll).
jJALMyBDfqOjzuuQAooDtw,FnG-s2YQWLLbbMU3jELxRg,nQ6kW3D9qscplBm01AtyhQ,1,Walked in at 9:13pm.  I was told I could only order to go as they were closing.  I said I thought they closed at 10:30pm.  They confirmed but told me that tonight was quiet so they wanted to close early... What???

jJALMyBDfqOjzuuQAooDtw,hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,vbGPCG1CF5Fv-jeA0oyZ0Q,3,3.5**..Food was good but LONG wait..I came here with two friends on a Saturday night and had a reservation for 7:00. The place is not fancy but seems to be well-liked as tons of people came for takeout/delivery. The restaurant was pretty full while we were there as well. This may have been the problem as I think the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed. The food took a really long time to come (around an hour till our first rolls came) so that got a little frustrating. We ordered a tempura; 3 specialty rolls and 3-4 regular rolls. We enjoyed most of the rolls but preferred the specialty ones. Tango Mango and The Tropical were our favourites. Hell; which was a fried roll with cooked salmon was also unique and yum. The quality was pretty good; not the best sushi I have had but one of the few good places in the area. Our waitress was super friendly and was apologetic for the wait...Overall; good meal but we will probably do pickup next time.
jJALMyBDfqOjzuuQAooDtw,rtQ5gKz8982aja96EUMooQ,azk2tzrJDbI4fdp0OJgYjA,5,Great place; the service was excellent. My friend had no appetizer with her meal; so to not let me eat mine alone; the house offered her a miso soup too! I found a great touch.Let's talk about the food; I ordered the sushi (11 pieces) variety and the pizza sushi was to die for; made with kanikama. The variety was great; all specialities. My friend got a salad. She goes there since a while and I'm very happy to had discovered this amazing place!.Its located on a second floor of the building; as I would not have gone straight up..Can't wait to go back!!!
jJALMyBDfqOjzuuQAooDtw,cXciolQyHZiW3uAB_dgPuQ,Pj-9QLEnXSmiKW8ViWetxg,4,My wife and I went here before going out for the evening and we thought it was great. I had the Sushi & Sashimi plate and my wife had the Matsu Sushi plate. The service was quick and the sushi and sashimi were excellent...The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because I found it quite dark and it was difficult fo read the menu. I found myself having to constantly twist and turn to find some light so I could see what was on the menu. That being said; it won't stop me from going back again.
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,paua782iHct_i0DEvkO2nw,NQ3z24su26D0l1ucgRxayg,5,I like Bonny's a lot. I always seem to order their house lasagna everytime I go. It's just so tasty. It's a quaint little spot; the staff is really kind and I've never left disappointed..Their burgers are also yummy and filling.
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,JZOjAlIMTk8iOTK5oSoDfQ,_ytk3hXp-OKHgh_MNxPUyA,4,This restaurant has the BEST soups; and their chocolate pudding is delicious. They accomodate gluten free too; but it generally means substitution. For example; a boca burger comes with no bun; but with hummus instead. .It's a nice atmosphere; and the prices are good. The best part is that it's all organic. :-).Their menu is ok; but the special is usually very special.
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,BY1exhWl0NAjPTIBZn1KLA,CklcMhO9Wbklq9Xtt7a1wA,4,I love the warm atmosphere and the selection of vegan options were very creative and delicious! The natural lemon water they serve at each table is definitely a nice touch.  I plan to be a regular at this place!
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,0iL5V6OzHrWE-CJXgsXvdQ,od2yx6fZoNETBH5RiaeO_Q,2,Overpriced. I mean the food was o.k but it is something I can make at home. The food took too long to get to my table.The staff acted weird with me.I am not going back.Very nice decor though.
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,RG-5GjxXd5VeGxjGtl3Vig,HyIroC0VyHaKH6onqvmm5g,1,I can honestly say that I think I would have done a better job in that kitchen if you grabbed me off the street; blindfolded me and threw me in there. The cook had no clue what they were doing; they need to choose another career path.
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,FV5kicZd2kh0Y90fO6i5gQ,P6b2ijdp3GLOkMdQEZ8uGw,1,We walked in and the place looks cozy; the service staff was friendly but a little dismissive when we just asked for the menu.  She was serving someone else and instead of acknowledging the request she suggested she was too busy at that moment.  Seemed like I would have appreciated her just remembering that we wanted the menu and she could have just given it to us later.  She was only serving 4 tables; and kept bringing the others the food; without giving us time to read the menu.  We chose the boca burger; which was black beans in a semi patty served on a piece of bread; smothered with salsa and nachos with a salad.  The salad was fine; but nothing special.   The burger was bland and the nachos were store bought and from the tasteless salsa; I suspect that too was bought at the store.  All this went for the expensive price of $14.50.  .We also ordered the special of the day; which was falafel sandwich rolled in a fajita; with salad and store bought plantain chips. Absolutely tasteless.  I also forget the tomato soup; quaintly served in a small coffee cup.  But that made it a miniature  portion!  This too came to $15.  So if this meal would have been less expensive; it would  have been considered fairly priced and it would have been bland but nourishing and good enough for a lunch.  But at that price I would have expected some effort and a least a nod to cooking for taste; I will say that it is a waste of money to go here.  All in all with taxes this meal came to $38; without the drinks.  I try so hard to cheer vegetarian food; and hesitated to write this review; but truthfully I feel gouged.
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,fi38ETFUNBBndrkKqLqUtA,FFPtRcKQpYoKnaSc3AwuCg,4,I discovered this restaurant as I was walking around Griffintown and felt the need to stop by and try their food; I was very pleased by the tasty food and the atmosphere of the place. Although the service is a bit slow (there seemed to be only one cook and one waiter on duty that day); the veggie burger I tried was both unusual and excellent; a fun surprise. I will definitely be going back!
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,dngihhhsWcvWPWHUnrFhBA,9U6elbOXWy-miUhZQjuZQw,4,This is a great joint for veggies/vegans! Lots of options that are solid. The deluxe nachos was really good. The lentil burger was made of a flavorful party of veg + beans. It comes with pickles; onions and mustard on top for a taste that reminded me a McDonald's. Get the St-Ambrose Apricot Wheat Ale! So refreshing!
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,43MHDlqPTO_fKZBAnJfRYw,jQ7zLeowg39XFTRYTUTcaA,5,What a pleasant surprise! From the cosy decor to the delicious organic and vegetarian food...big thumbs up!.The lentil burger was out of this world - the best vegetarian burger I've had in Montreal so far.  Really nice healthy flavours!.The carrot cake was really tasty and did not last long....Gluten free options as well..The service was fine but could have been a little more smily. .It's a great little spot in griffin town - we need more organic and vegetarian restaurant like this one in Montreal!.That's all you need to know.
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,1TIDqlO1Q0bmJrni8EJXSQ,X7qA3Bws2OCQH4FQiEi0UA,4,The competition is tough in Montréal; even for vegetarian restaurants. Bonnys isn't the best; but it is very good; and would probably get a five star rating from me in most other cities. If you're looking for vegetarian or vegan food that is more like comfort food; rather than raw bowls with tempeh; then Bonnys is one of the best options Montreal has; and well worth trying.
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,Br9bkJqjKms9BjvKWZsgwA,-pYHRHaFPBNo7AeZpHWTHA,4,Located in a neighborhood famous for the night life and restaurants this restaurant is a very good option if you are looking for vegan and delicious food. I tried lentil burger and I highly suggest it. Combination of flavor and spices makes the food very delicious and different. Salad was fresh and dressed nicely. Other players were also tempting and eye catching. The only problem with the food was rather small portions for some dishes they have on menu. The dessert was not as good as the main dish but it us different. Their service is slow which is normal for a restaurant run by two but for busy hours might be difficult to manage.
jk0StiAMwYlye6kHMHvduA,6CbfxVLaQD9q_7HTeM-x4A,oZlnK1-ZxPWOtuKhhyZ4eg,4,Ditto to all the other reviews. It is a quaint place and cozy with yummy comforting; fresh and local food.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,Ot3pZSB9DdWmQpbi0DSFhw,g9H92Ax2sEyhDhwRQRBbzw,3,We were starving and came across this place; and because of the cheap prices for lunch; we decided just to eat here.  Lunch came with choice of soup; rice; and an egg roll.  We had the singapore noodles with shrimp that costs 4.25 and the hunan beef which cost $6.  Both were actually quite flavorful; however we could have done without the egg roll which was essentially just stuffed with bean sprouts.  The wonton soup and hot and sour soup were also nothing special.  At least we came out full...both our bellies and our wallets!
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,aud-Vk1VFYBYxxVSSwkMIw,j1T9FtEa-hVm2V1Nk_eoLA,4,I've been to this place a few times; and keep wanting to go back. If I had to recommend one dish; I'd suggest you try the Pekking Duck. ..Go for tasty Chinese comfort food; and bring good company. In the multiple times I have been there; I have never had rude service; in fact it has always been decent (in reference to other reviews).  ..Last time I went I wrote a review that you can read here:..http://www.forgetthebox.net/mag/wine-dine-montreal.php
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,985_A0PdZmfbVB1wdlHPzA,I5xpQAqbFpSzwKIe67lU9g,1,Absolutely the worst chinese food I have had in a long while. .- The tables were dirty as hell..- The service was very very very slow. We waited for at least 40min to get 2 dishes. We ordered one veggie and one tofu; and it was at 9PM on a Wednesday night. What took them so long? Who knows.- The food did not taste authentic (my mom and i are both chinese and we both hated the food). The veggie dish was way too oily and the tofu dish was tasteless - it literally only tasted like tofu and that was about it..- The price was affordable but definitely NOT reasonable. it costed us $36 in total for 2 dishes with no meat; and 2 bowls of rice. The owner recommended us their lobster dishes; and some seafood soup - they sounded pricy and they probably are. I did not feel I got what I paid for...DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE FOR CHINESE FOOD.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,JZ7RPFpDhPHa4ay_wTnRDA,_StiX_axscph4vr0mh85tg,2,My elderly relatives chose this restaurant for dinner during my visit. I was automatically concerned when I saw the reviews on Yelp; but hoped for the best. ..The duck platters were delicious; but everything else was heavily salted. One of the waiters even joked about the large amount of MSG they use; but afterward I realized he might have been telling the truth.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,ojZ56Y7MaHfYtpK1oTwnJA,KaTeWDbsII5fS_UMIleOzw,3,I asked the server what kind of sauce was the XO sauce.  He told me it was an Asian sauce.  I was thinking; DUH; I'm in an Asian restaurant!  So the server was not knowledgeable and a little condescending.  That's okay though because the mixed seafood with XO sauce was good.  I think there were way too many snow pea pods on the dish but for the price it was worth it.  I think this place is better for groups than a solo diner.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,yUk9mGnz729OOwzKuv-tzQ,Tb0r-_Ov0leGSmCXECH8LA,4,Sometimes the best places are the most unassuming. Mon Shing certainly falls under that category.  Our family of 5 ordered two combo meals with the menu indicating that each meal was large enough to feed two people.  The amount of food not only fed us all; but we had ample amounts of food left over for dinner the next day.  This restaurant was also very reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend this place if you have a craving for solid; reasonably priced Chinese food.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,QFUB1cTc3EGN8v13T7CtnA,ppHngMdjjVcugPulCK4aEQ,5,Food is excellent! Looks very inconspicuous but really great tasting dishes. We ordered lobster with ginger; general tao; beef flank with flat noodles; and fried mustard greens.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,82vSXGC55BOPssPCs5ea4w,hrmsWIjySJUi3hBNVZCsPw,4,While wandering around Chinatown looking for a place to have lunch we stumbled into Mon Shing...I ordered the watercress/shrimp ball soup and my husband got some Singapore noodles; we also shared shrimp dim sum..I loved my soup; it was great and so were the dim sum; the noodles were okay - nothing special; I drowned them in sriracha which helped a great deal..The service is a little on the cold side but I didn't really care; it wasn't bothersome..Prices are very reasonable...We will be back; because I want to try more of their soups (bird's nest for one).
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,qYVbnGqFLo0NPsGzwmkv2g,vEgpkWH9zPc09hQsSUQ6yQ,2,Bad food and horrible services! Absolutely not recommend this place! I will give no star!!!
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,yRnVFUIv2RuTc075Gff63Q,HnYeEWWtiNXsihIe2ge0-Q,2,I had been walking all around the city all day with some visiting relatives; and we were starved.  Mon Shing had a fairly decent crowd inside; so we figured it must be good...The entrees all came out at once -- except for mine.  Though my family members offered me a few bites from their giant plates; we hadn't planned to share full-scale; so I mostly just sat and waited for my food; feeling too hungry to even engage in conversation...We tried to get the waiters' attention to ask if my entree was on its way or if it had been forgotten.  The first couple of times the guy blew right by us.  When he finally did come to our table; he seemed angry; and he blamed the kitchen for not making my dish. ..At last my food came out.  Actually the waiter FLUNG it on the table with a loud clattering sound; not saying a word.  So I started eating my dinner around the time everyone else at my table was finishing theirs.  ..The dish was tough; grisly MSG chicken -- and I know I shouldn't have expected more from a cheap Chinese place; but after that long wait I had really counted on something good.  ..Two stars because the unappetizing food doesn't cost much; and there's a lot of it.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,IkB10gnyHk8tf85j59GWAw,PnuJuy_udrTQuDZna7qnKQ,4,If it were up to my 9 year-old daughter; we would have eaten lunch there everyday. A bit of a hole-in-the-wall restaurant but a great find. Shrimp ball soup was delicious as was the pepper tofu.My son ordered the sweet & sour chicken (run of the mill yet good) and calamari (delicious). My husband and I ordered the baby mustard leaves as well as an order of vegetable in broth; both were extremely tasty and pleasing. Someone mentioned the cold service and; although would agree upon our first visit; the second time we stopped there for lunch (on the pleading of our daughter); the service was warm and extremely attentive. ..The place seems very popular with the local Chinese community and the restaurant was practically full on our second visit. A few other locals but little to no tourist. Very enjoyable atmosphere. ..We recommend Mon Shing without hesitation and look forward to a future trip to Montreal where we will dine here again.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,q0x0Tke2gwXIExbITSLskg,YI_1KBIsiFuK7qPgyAXfvA,1,Cheap; lot of food; lunch special combinations is what I can say about this place. I was so hungry that I could have even ate a horse. There were several restaurants around in the china town and this restaurant got my eye and I immediately dropped in. The waiter who waited on me looks very rude and pissed off. He saw me and asked if I was the only person dining in; I said yes; he looked at me and took me over to a table. ..He got the menu and threw it on the table in front of me. I was hungry and I didn't had the patience to give him the taste of my fiery fists. just kidding. I simply ignored his discourteousness. I went ahead and took a lunch special which includes plain rice served with egg roll; a side dish (I opted for sweet and sour chicken) and a small bowl of soup (Chose hot and sour chicken soup). ..As soon as I ordered; he grabbed the menu card; barged into the kitchen; got a kettle of tea and placed it on the table and moved on with his business. I poured myself a cup of tea and started sipping. ..He served me the bowl of soup which was thick and fantastic; I really thought of having one more bowl but wasn't able to tolerate his behavior. So; I just waited for the rest of the meal to be served. ..The egg roll was too oily but tasted good and the chicken was too sweet. Disappointed with the service; with the food and the ambiance. Nothing was special there except for the soup...I finished my food quickly; sipped one more cup of tea; paid the bill at the counter. Even the owner of the restaurant is one boorish impudent living soul. Just handed her the money and left. ..I would recommend you all not to come to this place if you want to keep away from the mannerless; ill-behaved service. I would give this place a zero but aah; maybe just the soup deserves a small brown star!
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,sSFXp6HO0-eckiyP2-0m9w,k0BG2gP0scOZLM90btJ5PA,3,No frills Chinese food; good prices and good portions.  Lunch specials are great value!   Can't go wrong with the Cantonese Chow Mien or the whole lobster when in season...For those of you who aren't used to the curt attitude of the waiters; don't eat in Chinatown and pay double at an restaurant in a strip mall in the suburbs.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,P_BsIX1h93u8lgiDXf-9CA,6iOIpvYrb3iQCmPv9PmjJw,3,The best thing this place has going for them is that they are opened late until 4am on weekends. I can speak Chinese and usually get the Beef chow fun; or Singapore Mai fun noodles which they do a pretty good job on.  ..I would never eat here in the daytime or even before midnight but after a night of going out; this is the spot for dining in or takeout.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,NdSNQXoxiFeNZQ1M6uB9fA,xKr1gd66JDcGUBsg5vTSNg,4,My friends and I were in Montreal for the weekend; and we decided to check out Montreal's Chinatown. It was around 5pm on Saturday; and after walking around for a bit; we decided we were hungry and wanted dinner. It was hard to tell which of the restaurants were good; since it was too early for the restaurants to be crowded; and some of them looked sketchy from the outside. We eventually settled on Mon Shing. ..We ordered spring rolls; fried wontons; yang chow fried rice (pork & shrimp); beef with chinese broccoli; mapo tofu (tofu with pork; scallions and spicy sauce) and 1L of the house white wine. The wine came out first; and was actually really delicious; and only $22. The food came out quickly and was good. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had; but definitely good. There was SO MUCH food. We finished the appetizers; wine and broccoli; but left half the fried rice and 3/4 of the tofu. It was all really delicious- we just couldn't finish it. With our check; they gave us 8 slices of oranges and 3 fortune cookies. Yummy! The meal took just the right length of time; and as we were leaving; there was a decent line of people waiting to be seated...Definitely go if you're hungry and looking for solid; cheap Chinese food. With tip; the meal cost us about $20 each for a liter of wine and more food than we could eat!!
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,bBzOlCXZKcwhmdITySeAhw,u6yencQMm7el31lFYp22Pw,2,Soirée de folie à Montréal et tous les restos du vieux port sont pleins alors on va vers le quartier chinois et c'est pareil. La file est moins longue dans ce restaurant; on décide de tenter notre chance ... .globalement assez aligné sur les autres commentaires laissés par les Yelpeurs:.- le service est 'strict minimum; table a peine nettoyée; y'a encore du riz des précédents qui colle a la table. Pas un sourire ou une attention quelconque; on est là pour nous nourrir et rien d'autre .-l'hygiène. Je dois dire que l'intérieur de la place est 'so; so' donc je sais pas si c'est une réflexion de l'état de la cuisine; mais tout du long je me suis dit qu'on commanderai que des trucs bien cuits et possiblement très épicés; histoire de pas prendre de chance avec une bactérie quelconque .- le menu. Aussi long qu'un annuaire téléphonique et pas de possibilité de vraiment demander d'explications car français et anglais sont assez sommaires; juste assez pour commander en gros...Sur la base des commentaires précédents on commande le chow mein aux fruits de mer; qui a été ok; même si le crabe n'en était pas vraiment (imitation); une soupe aigre douce; plutôt fade mais avec un peu de sauce soja c'était ok; et une soupe wonton qui a priori était bonne..On nous a servi un pot de thé en place de carafe d'eau et finalement de l'eau bouillie c'était quand même plus rassurant que de l'eau fraîche dans ce contexte..Donc on a mangé; et on a pris un moment à payer car l'organisation est pas optimale..Pas le lieu de l'année clairement; pas ma meilleure expérience du quartier chinois; mais on n'a pas été malades et donc malgré tout peut-être que mon impression est biaisée par des peurs personnelles mais non fondées; mais je prévois pas d'y retourner.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,SAeScmq3cxbikwnjyTqjxQ,UHzpr8agbe2phlkADFBEvQ,2,Wow i used to come here and was younger..First time coming back in years. Did not enjoy it.The waited kept pushing me to get the lobster;crab and other expensive dishes...Typical chinese western food catered towards tourist or drunk people at 3 am. Food was not good;small portions and more expensive than his neighbors...Took the salt and pepper fried calmari; not bad...Ying yang fried rice;almost no chicken nor shrimp...Lastly crab yee meen; very fastly made with ugly presenation and not much taste..Go to keung kee restaurant upstairs instead if u want real authentic chinese food.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,VskB-ddvXxSpOkjnNs5DrA,qarGRdD3_7-XC3FyD5-R8Q,1,Came here for lunch after the dimsum line at Maison KamFung was too long. I had asked a random person on the sidewalk for a recommendation and was led to here. Growing up in Queens; I've eaten at a fair share of Chinese restaurants and am used to the brisk attitude of the help but this was the absolute worst dining experience I have ever had. ..1. The waiter refused to take our order; instead giving us a piece of paper and telling us to write down the number of the items that we wanted. I had thought that maybe this was a restaurant practice but saw our very own waiter take down somebody else's order. On top of this; he was scowling the entire time and took his fair time fulfilling our requests for water and tea. .2. The wait. We ordered around 8 dishes and they were brought out with in sets of two or three for no particular reason with 20-30 minute intervals in between. The restaurant was not full and it was not a banquet style meal. .3. The food. Typical take out Chinese food with an emphasis on oil; msg and sweet and sour sauce. The sweet and sour chicken had about 15% meat; the rest was all fat. .4. There was a lunch special menu that was purposely not given to us due to the fact that us ordering a la carte was more profitable. Taking a quick look around; it was given to all other parties. When I brought this up to the manager; she simply gave me a blank look and said so. I was not looking for money back but an apology or explanation would have been sufficient...Stay far away from here; I regret wasting one of my meals in Montreal at this place. I would given it negative stars if I could.
JOKoBRVZntmng3Iw6aSg2w,Kchj2U3yTo1hOZoiOkcErA,3SNSrTX0Y8CsrlssuAVWpQ,1,Mon Shing; where bad service is the thing.....So we had finished up a morning of exploring the Jardin Botanique and were thinking Chinese food so a trip to Chinatown was in order...And Mon Shing seemed promising enough at first; with a $28 feast for two people that would satisfy our cravings...The place seemed authentic and there were plenty of locals happily lunching. It's a testament to the diversity of Montreal that in a Chinese restaurant you can hear so many different languages spoken. ..I should have known to retreat and flee the scene when the waiter yelled to me; after asked if they have bottled water; Across the street! and motioning to some other establishment...There was enough oil and grease on the initial spring roll to have been left over from the BP spill...The shrimp ball soup was actually tasty and was the highlight of the meal (not including our exit; of course)...The fried shrimp was way too salty and left a bad aftertaste in my mouth...The rice that accompanied our main course of chicken consisted of shrimp; pork and peas. The peas were barely defrosted; as in; I could still taste the freezer...Our chicken was tough; stringy and obviously a cheap cut. ..Poor service combined with sub-par food makes for a 1 star review. Fortunately the aftertaste of this place was washed away by the gourmet food festival going on at Poinet-a- Calliere museum.
jyTz3kid7Xr_V0bj9vxTKA,3AxAep0OMmy_LgidsYMdog,9JTr1H1LrE4jcPTaT9ptEw,4,Came because of Groupon deal and tried their bulgogi BBQ which was very good. Overall very much home-made style. Pancake was so so but their sausage was very interesting; never had it in other Korean places. Price is average Korean restaurant.
jyTz3kid7Xr_V0bj9vxTKA,UbbUs97kVDWDNTh59D85_Q,BPjOnE35WS9T8_vI9xM7Pg,2,Not very recommended. Not many choices in the menu. A little bit pricey. No lunch set. Korean side dishes not very tasty.
jyTz3kid7Xr_V0bj9vxTKA,VN1ZuBylzKw4RCHyAY1wiA,B9RFBAgXtVCDiyOMamPGrg,5,My best Korean Restaurant to go in Montreal.Always satisfied with wonderful meals and happy people who work here..Since I know this place; it's hard for me to find anywhere else as good as this :)
jyTz3kid7Xr_V0bj9vxTKA,UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,9UnR13_IUEmRa1MHChII5Q,5,This place has been opened for 20 years. I'd say it is authentic Korean food; probably owned by a couple. .The location was not near a metro but can be accessed by a bus. Also some parking spots reserved for the restaurant..There were not many tables but with a big room for party with karaoke. I guess it's a good way to get together; singing and eating at the same time. The deco was neat and warm.  .They have blood sausage filled with rice as the appetizer; which is very rare to see in North America. I had to try this after I saw it..Their specialties are soup/stew. First the samgye tang; is a half cornish hen filled with sticky rice and slow cooked for hours. It may tasted mild but drinking it in a cold winter made me feel hearty and healthy. It comes with salt w/ chili so you can dip the meat adding more flavor. There was a ginseng inside the chicken which seems fancy and nutritious. .We also ordered soup with blood sausage and intestine; served in a hot pot boiling. I assume this is a very genuine Korean meal. This soup came with two home made special sauces to add more unique flavor. The third recommended dish is Gamja Tang; spicy pork rib soup. This soup can tell you how genuine a Korean restaurant is. I probably will try it next time..Also tasty side dishes came before meals. We asked more for kimichi after we finished the first plate. Yum.
jyTz3kid7Xr_V0bj9vxTKA,ETk-jcQbgVCNMGLsRCYATg,HQGCkmLThy8pTXwmZkBp3g,5,Went today with a groupon. Food was very good and service was good too. ..We ordered a Korean seafood pancake; skate fish sashimi; two beers (Tsingtao); and a goat meat stew for two. Very delicious. ..Seems to be family owned. I would recommend. Thanks again! a++
jyTz3kid7Xr_V0bj9vxTKA,SUz5VOeZCovxWQhnSxib2w,W_RBw6IkPwHPRAFjH-UAaA,5,Le Resto coréen de mon préférer! J'habite à plateau; mais  je conduis 20 mins pour aller manger chez kagopa ! Ce sont les vrais coréens qui cuisiné le goût est très très bon!la madame qui cuisine est super gentille et je suis même fais exprès d'aller la voir. Leur menu spécial est toujours une surprise pour moi! Ça fait plus que 5 ans je mange chez kagopa!
jyTz3kid7Xr_V0bj9vxTKA,x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,_PY5bc0zylz9O2j34FbWpg,1,Worse Korean restaurant I have ever been!..$106 before tips for 3 people and we almost didn't eat anything...Seafood pancake was undercooked ~ you can still see uncooked lumps...Bbq for 2 people and they gave u 3 pieces of galbie and few slices of pork belly. Must be kids portion because no way 2 adults would feed of that...Korean spicy rice cakes had maybe 10 pieces on the plate...There are so many Korean restaurants in the neighbourhood that please go somewhere else...They probably told their family to write the reviews...4.5* is definitely not possible!!!
KDdUiwg_r37o4P0JNIFHZg,dhPp4t9_fD0R0eNsp_gYZw,eBflGPHVpetaA3WM-7SLlA,3,Saq is definitely not LCBO.  I mean both have a very limited selection of options but this Saq should have been much larger for a downtown location.
KDdUiwg_r37o4P0JNIFHZg,OnhM-m4MHhgWGiBWd9apYg,TzyIZ8_MJ6iWbYMVRtHHNw,3,Small; with just the basics.  Don't expect to run into any mixologists here.  (God I miss BevMo!)
KDdUiwg_r37o4P0JNIFHZg,tdY-XWVOyg-ZJvjjLyMbWQ,ClziFd9xYOQzBasBDWaPqw,3,Small but reasonably stocked retailer; two narrow aisles run the length of the store with wines $10+; adequate selection in the $20 range. France and USA are over-represented in wines; other countries (literally Autre Pays in their signage) much less so. Small selection of basic spirits but not much for beer choices; though there are a few ciders / rosé type options too. ..Hours are good til 10pm each night; nice for visitors staying at various area hotels.
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,LNUjBENGzo3Oe8vqljYb_Q,mi2SOvYYqHGH12RMiwd0xw,4,The food is VERY good ! We were looking for fried dumplings and found this place on Yelp; but were really sceptical seeing the place; it is kind of old and not really attractive. But no disappointment ! We tried the won ton shrimp soup et the porc fried dumplings and they were excellent. Authentic Chinese food.
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,En4LzJjcAmc3IX4Yf-FvzQ,J1MgbiXrur2YcT1yAAGtBw,1,The worst ever! Horrible food and terrible service! The wonton is meatless. I came from 7:40 set there for more than an hour untill the the food is served at 9pm. Worst experience and worst food in Canada! Trust me just leave this one!
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,j-7YRMmL2pcVtCbdv-DcnA,m0BqInOtPatX-1zXtOXvcg,4,Had 4 plates here; many to chose from; all ours were excellent.  Shrimp dumplings; pork dumplings; some beef noodle thing and vegetable plate.  Ate everything (we were very hungry.  I will definitely return   Service was good and they were happy we enjoyed.
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,EoWVBtRYSBb6EsA71CTq3g,Rsv-VgTUGwCcPU6EASpICw,3,I ordered some dimsum there. It is so-so. There are other better restaurants than this one. Moreover; it takes quite a while to get your food even though there are almost no one in the restaurant
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,K_H2SLOudDpujs2cTgPRzg,gKuSQxOIWrHbJuuoCJ45rg,4,This cheap hole-in-the-wall in Chinatown has approximately 100 items on the menu (that's a fact; not an exaggeration).  I tried the singapore noodles for lunch and they were quite good!  And actually; the egg roll was delicious and meaty; better than average...I give 4 stars to any restaurant I want to go back to; and this is one of them.  Lots of interesting and cheap food on their menu that I'd like to explore.
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,14RtuCACAEfVva23vvrv1w,kT_VZ_IcgJLIXLJ91ZWUMQ,4,The fact that they say they make their own noodle attracts me to try this place out...I ordered a dumpling noodle soup (水餃湯蛋面) and prawn wonton soup (淨蝦云吞). The egg noodle is quite nice and not soggy. It might be true that they made the noodle themselves but I can't really prove that. The dumpling is just okay; can taste a bit of pork and lots of black fungus. The prawn wonton is made with prawn and a bit of pork...Considering the reasonable price on the menu; the place is okay. I'll definitely come back with my #heart to let him try it.
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,QxY-3tE7bvsy_jwWrOwBNg,5,The noodles themselves are unique as they differ from the others around. The noodles at Sai Gwan are egg flour noodles and are not the wheat-flour pulled noodles as some noodle-heads are used too. I ordered the wonton lo mien; which means mixed noodle. The soup comes on the side and you can spoon it over each bite as you make your way through the dish; or sip it on its own. The noodles sit in a puddle of a soy sauce and oil mixture with sugar and white pepper with scallions (mixing is necessary). Coincidently; you've just been witness to the shattering of a world record of how many times the word noodle can be used in a paragraph...There are certain things you order at different restaurants if you have any clue what you're doing there. You're not going to a truck stop to order their version of Boeuf Bourguignon. To give this place a bad rap based on your own ignorance is unfair.  Have their specialties; everything else is just filler.
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,JV0ddUHPHHsB7GUs2RAH6g,D3rkdol4LTkxrbWlNJqNOw,1,Ordered takeout yesterday. Waited a while before they took my TAKEOUT order and then waited another long while before my order was ready.  Finally I realized they left one dish out of my order when I got home. Never going back.
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Mtw-m-UZsP6opt6pE4i7EQ,4,There's always a fine line with hole in the wall restaurants. Will it be good? Inexpensive? Authentic? Clean (relatively speaking of course) Yes; yes; yes; more or less...They advertise homemade noodles and dumplings; and the product lives up to that. The wonton stock is flavourful and light on the MSG. I would highly recommend any of the wonton noodle dishes. Dim sum portions are more modest than any big resto dim sum you might expect; but you can take heart that it really was handmade. Any noodle dishes with beef flank also recommended. ..Typically I get hot pot with some combination of Chinese sausage; chicken; mushrooms; this time I ordered the salted fish black bean hot pot; which is okay but not as great as the other choices. ..Don't take your first date here; wait until at least date five. Don't take her parents if you're hoping to impress. You've got a friend who loves discovering great food off the beaten path; take them here.
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,l2KQ6jm88t_tT7LLdxpuvA,28IgIPuBn7QXnwtViF5dnA,5,This place must be better known for its excellent tasty food!!!! It's so cheap you'll want to eat more than one dish!!! It's not the prettiest restaurant and it looks a little bit sketchy but the food there is DELICIOUS. Will come back for sure! SO CHEAP.
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,INIZn6c-vPuTS2JnhwXYcg,1cJ3fE6V5sFUSt1cH-B_xw,5,Don't be fooled by the appearances. This place is fantastic. Very tasty food and cooked fresh upon ordering. Dumplings and fish balls are a must.
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,LqywrHdM-H8gSdKtGrhBuw,v9kO7G4R2SmZFvnhfgB0Qg,4,Had a very enjoyable dinner that started off with a delicious Hong Kong style milk tea; Pork Lo Mein and a Wonton noodle soup as main dishes...The best was their home made noodles; that remind me of Hong Kong...The service was great the price was even better..Definitely recommended. Next time I will try their dim sum...Cons: little place and decor is minimal
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,EaBKe-8LB-NHuH7Us-QhGw,C1lWddmuFNL_lwCcf00sJw,4,Small hole in the wall place in a deserted street in Chinatown; they serve old schools Cantonese dishes such as Lo mien; hot pot rice; and wonton noodles. The place looks like an old Chinese diner from the 70s; and it looks like it hasn't changed at all. The food is extremely inexpensive for the quality and the attention to detail; which is surprisingly high considering that it's basically a Chinese fast food place. ..I ordered a shrimp caviar noodles with Beef Brisket lo mien; the noodles were tasty; bouncy; the brisket melted in your mouth and packed with flavour. The noodles are pulled in store; which is quite a treat when they are well done; and this place pulls one of the best in town...4.5 stars any day...Really nice service too. Like amazingly friendly.
KLwTrBLp9ClmH35ZBAlbYg,89pzKs31Wl2-bKY6U3AGmg,0EgHdkxWYfqI8YSz36HGAQ,3,I've had better for the same price. I had the #50 (soup). The noodles were still raw but I guess if they were squishy and raw it means they used fresh noodles; which is a win. They only take cash. For two people we paid ~$22 which includes tip. Is it a win? You decide. As a tourist; it wasn't the best place to go; but for a cheaper outing with friends could be good. Again; I've had better for the same price range but maybe it was unrepresentative. The servers were so kind which was a huge contrast to what I'm used to!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,CeZZeAo6kqiU8kmcqHVvbw,H0fhzmq9w7VlFY7VKLFKog,3,I went here two times during my week in Montreal.  The first time I ordered the smoked meat sandwich and poutine.  The sandwich was rather bland; nothing to write home over; but the poutine parisienne was really good.  Another night I ordered the pasta alfredo....it was horrible!!!  It was bland; tasteless; for $16 came with no salad or piece of bread; it was like spaghetti with Elmer's Glue.  I wouldn't recommend that dish; there are other places you can go for much better pasta!..The service was so-so.  I ordered to go both times and the waitress was attentive enough; but as I sat there watched the wait staff play and text with their phones.  Hilarious.  This Dunn's is also located right next to a XXX massage parlor....just an FYI if you're thinking about brining the kids lol.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,lA9KLDUBxDsPTL58hHXlPQ,BPqlAPHm5_e1cYTcHd_Grg,4,I stopped in here while my friends were at the hockey game. I was dying to try authentic Canadian poutine! I sat at the bar and I ordered Dunn's original poutine with smoked meat. I watched the hockey game while I waited and within a short amount of time I had my poutine. It was delicious! Way too much for 1 person; but I made a good dent in it!.Service was friendly and the place looked like a great place to grab some pub food.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,rm92EiaA7h5lLbAK5dJKcw,-DyKIxjLUPxvBAJ_1rDWqQ,4,Poutine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..Okay; so this wasn't the BEST I ever had but I still really enjoyed the poutine they served here.  Let's put it this way; I liked it enough that I went two days in a row.  That's also because I really liked their smoked meat sandwich platter ... which was just awesome.  The meat was good and I actually enjoyed this more than Schwartz's.  Yeah yeah call me crazy but I felt the meat here was more tender and juicy.  As someone who's lived off Jewish delis pretty much most of my life in NYC; I guess there was just something about Dunn's smoked meat that seemed to fit my palate better...The service here was decent.  It got kind of busy both nights I was here but the servers were all still attentive and checked on us to make sure things were okay.  I was too pleased with my meal on both nights honestly to notice anything else ... so you get the idea...That's not to say you shouldn't visit Schwartz's.  But if you're not near that area and you're looking for a good plate of meat and fries oozing with gravy and cheese curds and you happen to be in the downtown area ... you can't go wrong with Dunn's!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,OTzAgRLafzhclnCVc2wuZA,IqNAJLeHTfEOGAJVA2YiQw,5,Cho and I were coming close to the end of our 24hr Montreal adventure; but we had to satisfy his Korean smoked meat rampage one more time even though it was 1am. Schwartz was closing so we opted for Dunn's- open 24 hours!.Both of us weren't particularly hungry as we had already eaten all day; so we decided to share the Rueben which comes with coleslaw; pickles and fries. We added smoked meat spring rolls. The total was about $25..The atmosphere was a classic 1960s diner which i loved. The place was quite packed. The service was appropriate as the waitress was busy..Tastewise everything was on point. Compared to Schwartz; the smoked meat at Dunn's is more fatty and moist which carries more flavour and with the cheese; dressing and self-applied mustard it was an explosion in the mouth. The Korean boy grinned with ecstasy. The meat at Schwartz is cooked longer; less moist but carries a bit more texture. The fries were crispy; and the coleslaw and pickles really balanced everything well..The Korean beast and I could have easily ordered another; the food was extremely satisfying. Stay tuned for the final episode of- 24 hours in Montreal with Tonka Tonka Cho...Service- 4/5.Location- 5/5.Atmosphere- 5/5.Cleanliness- 4/5.Food- 5/5.Price/Value- 4/5..Would i return? Yes!

kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,6yTV_iirY6r21EeTRGPGqA,hvY-skKtneqsBdhRE-HcGQ,4,The conspiracy theorist in me is starting to think everyone gets their smoked meat from the same place. Do the French just sous vide everything?  Montreal pastrami has replaced NYC as being the best; in my book. This is going to cause problems in my marriage to a New Yorker. I'm still with him on bagels though so I think we're good. ..This is my third restaurant and they've all been tender and delicious. I ordered a petit combo which was half a smoked meat sandwich; coleslaw and fries. Your typical platter. Zero complaints.  I do love the Montreal style of coleslaw (no mayo like its American counterpart)...I've yet to try Schwartz. Felt like I should gear up to them so I know what I'm talking about when I go visit the king of smoked meats. Have to say; it's not boding well for them as it seems you can get a really good sandwich just about anywhere.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,_H1mZU8T3TY_khvWwibXaw,fMU0MLAkcBO6ns5MxMMYdQ,4,You don't go for the ambience; which is dated but somehow appropriate for this iconic establishment. Been here many times and you can never go wrong with the traditional smoked meat sandwich.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,Db2crIdEC370enbpgY4Zlg,v5YvSyo89cfFjO7djKXvYA,3,Decent food; priced well with good service. I think the menu pictures make it look a tad better than it actually is. Worth giving a shot. I had the fried rice dish; was tasty and filling.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,Ixh_GF46_a-vzATI-LMj_A,5,DINER HEAVEN ..This is the original location of Dunn's Famous that opened in 1927. It's a diner that serves a little bit of everything. Our mission was to have the smoked meats and poutine. We arrived after 1pm when the Canadians hockey game started up the street. We wanted to plan it that way; so there wouldn't be a wait for a table. I want to say that we timed it perfectly. In fact; it started getting crowded as we were waiting for our food here. The best part is that the game was on the tv and we could enjoy watching it. ..Our waiter was Fred and he was really nice. He was able to answer all of our questions and provided excellent service. We started out with two beers for us and a bowl of soup for the little one. I went with a Rickard's Red and my wife had a Coors light. I told her that the Coors was basically Canadian beer since Molson was brewing it up the street using Canadian water. The Coors in Canada has no Rocky Mountain Water in it. ..The soup was really good. Imagine a baked potato that was turned into a creamy soup and then covered with all of the baked potato toppings including cheese and bacon.  The dish is brilliant because baked potatoes come free with entrees and I'm assuming the left over potatoes become soup. I love smart chefs. I do highly recommend the warm soup on a cold day. This soup hit the spot because it was totally cold in Montreal. ..I also wanted to try poutine for the first time. I can not believe I've spent my culinary life avoiding this. I really didn't want to eat it in America. I think I wanted my first poutine to be an original and that's why I ordered it here. I also kept it simple by going with the gravy and cheese curds on top of the fries. I must admit that it was really good plus I had to fight my little one when eating these. I find it amazing to introduce brown gravy and curds to a child who instantly falls in love with the dish. I've got a little foodie on my hands. ..Our main entree was the Ruben sandwich which was huge. It comes with fries; baked potato or rice. You can always upgrade the side for a price. We went with the onion rings for an additional $3. I figured we had enough fries with the poutine. The sandwich was amazing and it was enough to feed all three of us. It was a double decker served with a pickle; Swiss cheese; thousand island sauce and coleslaw on the side. It was truly delicious. ..I also want to share some info about the meat. Montreal is famous for their smoked meats and the process they use really shows in the final product. A Montreal meat is brined for 14 to 20 hours and then smoked for 9 hours. Where an American corned beef is rushed with a brining as short as a few hours and then the meat being steamed for three hours. The Montreal version of corned beef will blow away your foodie senses. The meat is basically a beef brisket and when you order your sandwich you can choose one of three cuts: fatty; medium or lean. We stick to the medium because we want that flavor marbled in the meat. The Montreal smoked meat dates back to the 1890's; so it's a must have. ..I highly recommend you get the smoked meats in Montreal. There are several old school places serving it. We choose this place because it's been doing it the longest. I wanted to go to a classic place that's been doing it right for almost 100 years. I can't wait to come back here. This place was a great addition to our culinary tour of Montreal.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,NkBuo3TZ489BzxHE1Nfmgg,_yjSYdPwgDjQ2xClhLb0lQ,4,I only had one one poutine my whole stay in Montreal and it was not the best but it was ok  although the service was quick
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,6GN1-lN562HbUOBN51AeYQ,FxG2KcMqiJhFLzYmOO-BZA,3,J'ai pris la poutine au smoked meat et j'ai été très déçu (j'aurais même mis 1 étoile si au final; je n'avais pas mangé à ma faim quand même). Les vieilles traditions ne sont pas toujours les meilleures
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,tky14SQ5NPXNKh2BWOO3Bw,4,24/7 restaurant; literally; so it is a place we go every once in a while when we find ourselves starving at 4am and everything else is closed. Everything is good; burgers; sandwiches; poutines; smoked meats; you name it. I usually go for a smoked meat sandwich and personally add chop liver all the time. That thing is not on the menu and I can't remember how come I got to know about this extra hidden feature; but somehow I know it and I always ask to put some extra chopped liver in my sandwich; check my picture. And I always ask for a chocolate milkshake mmm yummy...
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,S2dghykbTLxHLv29XOumZw,4RkjSXIhJ7_wItm9AlO2Lw,4,When I travel I want to eat in a local place; not a chain or a tourist trap.  We were in the business district within walking distance of Old Town; Chinatown and museums and asked the front desk for a local restaurant.  Dunn's they said; a local chain with good food and good prices...They were right about that!  Think NYC Jewish deli meets 24 Jersey diner with big menu at good prices.  Smoked meat is a Canadian obsession and theirs is an excellent example.  Moist; lightly smoked brisket on rye with fries; slaw and a pickle; who could ask for more?  Sorry; no Dr. Brown's soda...This is not Texas smoked; but milder with great flavor and tenderness.  The menu covers just about everything including pizza and poutine; fries; cheese curds and gravy plus multitudes of variations.  Didn't try it on this trip; but poutine is another obsession; right up there with hockey...My daughter had a medium burger which she said was correctly cooked; juicy and flavorful...They; like most of the restaurants in our trip had at least a beer and wine license.  Hear that Jersey?..Well worth the trip.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,cNFGtKR8CavnmGP7JS7URg,NlhguqzzWgBhUl8LE8MKRg,4,Fabulous smoked meat sandwiches.  Probably most similar to what Americans would call pastrami.  It could give the really good pastrami deli's a run for their money.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  We came with 6 adults and 2 toddlers.  The hostess brought some paper and crayons to entertain the toddlers.  I took a star off because the fries were mediocre.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,a5GRAzUpKpdRmhLI67tGDA,3vVc6zs5njWz0sdJ_3oJ4Q,4,Loved the smoked meat; it was juicy and tastes delicious. Was not loving the fries though. I ordered the spring roll as appetizer and I was not sold either. I will always come back for the smoked meat sandwiches though.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,WPB8yGhBbwWWZwrORAdFJA,QGUf-deCNxUrEwBdRVuFZg,3,Psyched to try classics..Sad to learn: cold cheese poutine..Smoked meat's just deli.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,dnzUsb3udF1DoqKOwwXBmA,khtVJiBmYxmx9Kaw5dto5w,5,Excellent! We asked our hotel's concierge where could we find a good smoked meat restaurant and he directed us in the right direction! So off to Dunn's Famous! We started our meal with wings (with the Buffalo sauce on the side). Now; as Americans we are wing connoisseurs; however; among wings connoisseurs your tastes may vary. Some like their wings fried very hard; some not so much. I'm on the not so much side which is why I gave this Restaurant overall 5 stars; but I didn't really care for the wings. My boyfriend; and most of my friends; prefer that their wings be friend hard; not me; and to me they were fried way toooo hard but the sauce did make up for it. ..But now on to the main event...the smoked meat. We both had the smoked meat plate which was smoked brisket on rye with mustard; and sorry; I insisted on adding Swiss cheese to my sandwich. It came with house made chips (fries) and homemade coleslaw. Yummmmm! Now the coleslaw was a bit different from what I'm used to. Everywhere I've been in Montreal; the coleslaw has been vinegar based and not mayonnaise based and I'll admit I really enjoyed it. It had a much lighter taste...Now as far as the sandwich is concerned; interesting. Now I'm from Philadelphia; PA and I grew up in Jewish Delis. Shout out to Murray's Deli and Hymie's Deli on Lancaster Avenue in Bala Cynwyd; PA. Best deli sandwiches ever. But back to my review; I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and it was so large that I could only eat 1/2 of the sandwich; 1/5 of my fries yet all of the coleslaw.  Delicious!! ..And the crazy part is that they're open some insane schedule; like 24 hours. Our server was great and she was very knowledgeable. I believe her name was Ali and she had quite a sense of humor. Yo be maybe 20 something; she ran that restaurant like it was no one's business. So if you are looking for great smoked meat; or are hungry after everything else is closed check out Dunn's. You won't be disappointed.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,mJwbp7_eg0J6e1KGYTVnDw,Awv3sCvVscP3mgcIDSXdFA,3,While I tend to mostly just end up in places during my Montreal visits; I always make it a point to go to Dunn's. The fact that it's 24-hours makes that easy. However I am SUPER PISSED that the peppercorn poutine (Poutine Parisienne) is not on the menu anymore. ..While I still will come here; I won't look forward to it as much. I used to have dreams about that poutine.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,OIAFoJ_qs8XS_MeIDDjt0A,zBT1opSxxuSzDFsHPg-K_Q,4,classic classic classic. A must go in Montreal if you're looking for a great smokemeat!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,O3pSxv1SyHpY4qi4Q16KzA,RVPGxdqTOJzVMBAhNI29eA,4,Montreal is famous for its smoked meat sandwiches so Gord and I had lunch today at Dunn's.  Gord and I both ordered Super Smoked Meat Combos (8 ounces of meat) with medium meat (so it was less lean).  Gord got his with a latke and I got mine with a baked potato. It was a delicious sandwich!  The meat was so tasty and tender.  Yum! Rebeccah was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,lLfqpp0jkTTxRo1ugCK2Uw,5,Un classique de Montréal; situé en plein centre ville.Smoke meat délicieux; à essayer à tout prix.Ambiance bistro; décor sympa; service très bon.Le midi il n'y a pas trop de monde; le soir un peu plus.Grand choix de plats.Prix abordables.A essayer vraiment!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,3kQsPgVgGkJ_FjCSXkWxzw,mVaZPmJVQfIHLW7ehAt5Dg,5,Great for lunch or late night snacking. Smoked meat poutine is delicious and competes with the best in Montreal.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,J92qe-cFrUdxS441JalA4Q,z39vwVrcG6dflBVDXN05sw,2,I would have given 4 stars because the food is great and affordable; but when the service sucks it ruins the experience.  I think we had the only crabby waiter in the restaurant.   No smiles; no small talk; rushed through everything; just plain old cranky.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,uA3R6aQ33sOBQyUod4MdGA,VUoLY23HEWPPwWK4nHYLbQ,4,I've been here three times and got something to go once. The staff speaks English and is very helpful. The pizza is actually pretty good. Their desserts are awesome!! It's a good place if you want good food but don't want to leave your comfort zone. The hours make it super convenient. It's a definite must see while in Montreal.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,2du8UWngTa8anhmmYa-HdQ,FMpU9kwOQf0Z95Ce08eVdw,4,Perfect location near downtown hotels and one of a few places open late night. A server and general manager from another restaurant it after their kitchen closed. ..I enjoyed the poutine and an Irish coffee. Reasonable prices and a wholesome; diner feel. ..Only reason it wasn't 5 stars was that the service was slow initially getting a menu and ordering. It was somewhat busy for the early morning/late evening.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,scfCHf6x9AUcKb2yXYcG6g,Jf0GEpcYIPdkHD51joFldA,4,This place was awesome. Everything we ordered came in huge portions and was delicious. Not to mention that our waiter was over-the-top friendly and conversational and prompt...I had the smoked meat sandwich and poutine with crumbled smoked meat on top of it. My wife had poutine and a delicious meat sandwich as well. We were both very happy. The beer was icy cold and service was prompt. The restaurant was clean and busy but service was quick. Overall we would definitely recommend this place to tourists checking out the Montreal smoked-meat scene.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,kwjfwrE4Qs6ZblePxNeQcQ,hU-t9tj6ZQgkvxNNpk-GLA,3,While casually strolling the streets we saw this place and thought we should come in and try the smoked meat. Why? There were pounds of smoked meat displayed in the window and I immediately turned into one of those cartoon characters. You know; the ones where they smell food and their bodies drift toward it. Yea; that was me when I saw smoked meat in the window...They have a pretty vast menu so I'm assuming there's something for everyone. My bf ordered the smoked meat sandwich and I ordered the poutine with smoked meat on top. The smoked meat sandwich was pretty good. The meat was tender and fatty and damn near melted in my mouth. The poutine was ok. I'm not sure why; but the smoked meat on the sandwich was a lot better than the smoked meat on top of the poutine. Also; I wasn't a huge fan of the gravy. It was kinda watery. I prefer gravy that's a bit thicker...The service was awful. We were greeted and given menus when we walked in but people kept walking by us until finally we had to flag someone down for waters. Then; they took our order (finally). It took forever to get the check and no one ever stopped in to see if we needed anything else. We ate; paid; and got the hell outta there. It could have been a 4 rating if the service wasn't so crappy.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,lA1GpTAn8eJJXrWUa2D7DQ,ynurWlPhRt3KJZoKbFrqGw,5,We had a great time here! Our server was so nice to us and the food was amazing. Some people complain that the poutine gets soggy but I think that was a great thing. It tasted good just like that! I drove all the way back to New York with leftovers from this place and they were still great which is saying something because I hate leftovers. Anyways; loved this place and its sporty Canadian vibe !
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,SpCFKj1ohSP_dfgb_K6YeA,LWdgO_uaU6zZv09wgn2tFQ,4,Disclaimer: I love smoked meat. Hot; freshly carved smoked meat (not the cold thinly sliced kind that you find in supermarkets). I also love my smoked meat thickly cut and medium fatty. Lean meat does not go with smoked meat. (You're thinking turkey or chicken - if lean meat is what you want.)..Ok; so being from Montreal my standards for smoked meat are high :)..Now I know the best smoked meat in town is a topic of discussion (like our bagels lol) - but I'm Team Schwartz's! Yes; it's not the friendliest nor the fastest service - and there's always a line-up (unless you go really late at night; which I highly recommend btw; great vibe with the staff!). BUT they know how to make their smoked meat!!..And when I'm either too far or too lazy to get to Schwartz's; my go-to place is Dunn's! Their smoked meat is satisfying - and has a nice fatty; marbling texture to it. Their fries are super crispy and good! And I enjoy their coleslaw and pickle too (and always get a Cott's Black Cherry soda). ..Again; like with Schwartz's - Dunn's isn't fancy. But they make a yummy smoked meat!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,R3RAH8TqErTzqMgdDN9aXw,_Ck8kni0ygp2nf_oJxRNcw,5,Great food. Melt in you mouth smoked meat. Kosta our surfer helpful and attentive but not intrusive. Definitely go back

The club is made with the same fresh bread as the smoked meat. The club sandwich itself was a bit dry but a little mayo does the trick. Definitely try this spot out!!!.Solo style hater!!!!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,LphSyaTmdE9LP_s1x-0NFw,rqbsUAMOtdaboV9NOlLjyg,3,Grosse soirée près de Peel ? Besoin de se rassasier avec du gras ? Poutine bien sûr !.Oui; mais si on a envie d'une poutine un peu plus grasse et dans un cadre un peu moins fast-food; on court chez Dunn's; ouvert 24h..Leur spécialité : la viande fumée. Alors quand ils en mettent dans leur poutine....On ne vient pas chercher ici la haute gastronomie; mais du réconfort. Et en réconfort; on est servi ! Les assiettes sont bien généreuses..Et pour ceux qui veulent un peu moins de réconfort; vous pouvez demander de la smoked meat lean..Le service pourrait être un peu plus aimable; mais on n'y fait pas trop attention à cette heure..Mise à part cette poutine smoked meat qui fait bien la job; Dunn's n'a rien d'exceptionnel..Attention les soirs de hockey l'endroit peut être vite rempli.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,kaij8B6O_up-NdLylOuWcg,5MP2aNwXOLaMC5M4phRhCQ,4,Checked out this place on the 13th; I had the chicken honey mustard salad without chicken lol but it was actually soooo good! The amount of toppings added to the salad was awesome - most restaurant just give mostly lettuce and it's disappointing..My fiancé had the bacon cheddar burger with mushrooms and smoked meat poutine. He liked it and said he would rate it 3.5. I would give a 4..So overall for tonight's visit we give 3.5-4.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,Pbf011IZ-KbfQs9VwVfBzQ,Qb0vl7oNEgeXPQ57RY6TOA,5,Everyone told me to come here for the poutine but fries covered In gravy and cheese curds just aren't my thing (forgive me). However this place is also known for its cheesecake which I did have. The carrot caramel cheese cake was heavenly!! You won't be disappointed.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,m8nO7eqQZSe-RWUUZrS4uw,U1sEJEPCAOYWNxuLc5JHJA,4,Delicious classic smoked meat
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,EPsWdQzalccFouFC4NDVeA,zjYcs_mdoz0CoxeRNh-Lag,3,Le smoked meat est super. Par contre; lorsqu'on y a été; le fromage de la poutine goûtait le vieux. Vraiment mauvais goût même si nous avons fait changé notre poutine. C'est décevant qu'après le retour de l'assiette; malgré le fait qu'on ai mentionné que ce n'était toujours pas bon; la serveuse n'ait pas offert un autre alternative.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,R9gihu1jxCtUl0BvIWWDdA,EVQ8rGj8vLX1QJ_0UC2YTg,3,Perfect place for quick in and quick out; our recommendation is the various Poutine and the smoked meat spring rolls.  The food is A-Okay and the place is casual; nice stop for a beer.  The feel is that of a tourist destination which was actually welcomed; it feels like a spot you'd hit in Times Square; folks from all over the globe; literally; sharing a beer and Poutine! Nice.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,jImKbs4In8xg5c73Gb0NTQ,XNEJqRsRtC7qkVGQmOWNog,3,I had their Reuben sandwich which was alright but did not enjoy their fries as much. The meat was more medium than fat thus a little on the dry side (I ordered medium-fat). Overall it was fine for smoked meat fix but expensive for the food and service level; as there are plenty others deli smoked meat alternatives in Montreal. The restaurant has a small outdoor seating area at the front but this is a busy street with many pedestrians and cars passing by.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,VeYm7sz3HKEYlS_h9BbdfQ,vbsZLz1vC4IRn_CkT2zvSA,4,I spent a lovely 8 days in Montreal; on a quest for superb Poutine. Dunn's was my favorite; very flavorsome gravy; chips cooked well and didn't go soggy quickly; cheese curds perfectly melted and infused throughout. Dunn's are famous for their smoked meats and Jewish deli classics which of course I also tried. Overall great food and one of my favorites in Montreal.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,k7pXrI7mLNnG59y1OYKFTQ,rJPIuoeUexz5I18TMRioGw,5,Loved this place. I went here with my family while we were staying in Montreal for the week. This was an inviting little restaurant with about a dozen tables and a bar. ..I ordered the hamburger steak and my wife ordered a poutine bowl. ..Our waiter explain how the poutine bowls in Quebec are the best around because of the curds. Mu wife agreed she bought the dish was delicious...I loved the hamburger steak. I usually am not a big fan of break anyway. I felt like I could eat more hamburger meat because of the lack of bread. It was great and it inspired me to recreate the dish at home...The waiters were awesome and we asked some questions about the area and they were very knowledgeable and friendly. It was a very chill atmosphere overall.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,laFwsknjneH2QoGeLbemTw,_gYUEc9wimJrgtwJQHXatw,3,Great place for a quick bite. The salads are surprisingly good but you should go there for their smoked meat Poutine It's open 24hrs
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,5l4cUy_IOQ9xMhCk9QhilA,7bPqTJVYdFEChu3CFnMSlg,3,The service here was amazing but otherwise it was just okay. The poutine was way too salty and came out luke warm plus I think it is overpriced for what you get. The coffee was very weak but it did the job. I didn't try the smoked meat and maybe I should have as that's what they're known for. I would go back just because the service was outstanding but I wouldn't get the poutine again.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,4ONcRRisDZkbV1cviA7nFw,dTIAt-xFqc8vUXc3NoD_-A,4,Je ne suis vraiment pas une fan de smoked meat; toutefois un collègue voulait s'y rendre par nostalgie. Le restaurant est dans une petite rue très sombre. Le look est en effet; très vintage. Bien qu'en plein milieu du centre-ville où la clientèle est généralement jeune ou encore tie and suits; la clientèle du Dunn's est une clientèle de têtes blanches sympathiques venant revisiter de vieux souvenirs. Mes collègues ont bien sûr pris du Smoked meat qu'ils ont adoré. J'ai plutôt opté pour le gigantesque Cheese burger bacon. Les frites sont parfaites et le burger juteux; armez-vous de napkins et d'un grand appétit....

kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,v77KDyTdoirLnVn_lkiOgQ,--u087r9SYF1-OK3VUdkqQ,4,Dunns famous Caesar Bloody Mary type drink is awesome! They will put the game on if a match is in progress. Specialize in smoked meat and poutine. Not hard to go gluten free here if you are into meat. Cool atmosphere and decor. I enjoyed the smoked meat with fried rice; tomato; shallots. Potato skins with cheese and bacon are awesome.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,mFwRTTDW0Yr-rFkTF2cFsw,Gie2-1lz8y39uo69ROUc-w,2,Dunns used to be the place I would go when I first got to Montreal;  but that slowly changed over time as I discovered much better places for smoked meat around the city such as the Main.  Dunns has that interesting diner feel to it and it's located at the heart of the tourist area in Montreal. ..Usually the service is alright here; but there have been a handful of times I've gotten service that is beyond terrible.  I'm not talking they were slow or forgot to fill our drinks terrible.  I'm talking they slammed drinks on the table; dropped food on our laps and acted like we were bothering them when we would do a simple thing like ordering. ..On top of this the portions have gotten much smaller and the smoked meat just doesn't cut it compared to other places around town.  This definitely is not a place I frequent anymore and it's mainly due to the staff.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,nSTtFdTn_msKn1zpTbGgmw,A5ZANVHYfmSZZqlVo0AlNw,4,I've never had a bad meal here and the service is always great.  This time I had the basic smoked meat platter and it didn't disappoint.  The meat was awesome - exactly what I was hoping for. A great place for kids; too.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,pB-Cw-3Uu4CQLMQwKoPgpg,7Mn0eAgRXVLXnYZr0SPKBQ,5,We had the super combo smoked meat; and paid $4 to substitute standard french fries with Poutine. The smoke beef and poutine were both excellent. I can recommend this place highly!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,IpO2GbD5J1dvJREp5KzRdQ,PF0w0XqPzcTbMxSCMffxXw,3,1st meal in Montreal since 25 years ago.  Thought we'd start off here at Dunn's knowing that the smoked meat is sold en masse at Costco. .Saving the real one to later in the week..chicken poutine = ok.matzoh ball soup = meh.smoked meat sandwich fatty = pretty delish.coleslaw side = nice offset.latka side order = greasy and dense.Atmosphere - not as active as remember.Service - efficient.Hoping for better smoked meat to be found elsewhere!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,RhCmG5FernPxZLAhE4z49Q,Htj3AP-FqJflSU_u8Itcrg,3,Should really be a 3.5 Star.  There around 10pm last night; place is pretty dear like the rest of the town on a Tuesday night.  Had theirfamous poutine.   Nice portion... For $14++; it better be nice portion!!!.What shall I say; taste like fries with gravy and smoke meat topping.  Nothing special; longing at it in a positive way; not bad..Worth the$14?  You pay for the central downtown eating.... .Maybe you get a bit more vibe over the weekend.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,jMpBkmBHjrkECTA_THZtfg,r7THL2vz217_zdcsXHbVrg,5,Another go to place that I always come for when I want some poutine with smoked meat on top. However; times have changed and they give a slightly smaller portion compared to previous years I have visited. I'd recommend their rib eye steak as well.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,Pzg_MZ6GlGD_Rh2Oh4wllg,KtEB-AM8TyZ5JB_BN_OZkg,5,Get off plane...head to Dunn's...then head over to see the family. Been going here since I was a tot. Last time I was here got my photo with a Senater/Former Habs coach...what more could you ask for when you fly in! Huge portions. That includes the cheese cake (in comparison to cheese cake I get served in restos out here in western Canada). Yearly stop for my family (still back in Montreal). I miss you; Dunn's; nearly as much as I miss Montreal. With love; Lina
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,l2KQ6jm88t_tT7LLdxpuvA,BX5J-JI6QLPlyQCupnd7oA,4,When your girlfriend/boyfriend asks you what you're craving and you don't know; well just say smoked meat and bring them here and say that a yelper gave that advice!!!!! ..It shows in the name of the restaurant; Dunn's FAMOUS !!! Yes it is a known place for its smoked meat! And yes you should try it out! The atmosphere depicts the taste of smoked meat. The food is really good; the fries are just right; homemade ! The meat was not too dry. May be crowded at lunch time. The staff was almost emotionless; but the service was correct and adequate. But hey! I came here for the food! So you should too!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,RrLRd9M2Q6iYCNnKMZsdtw,UlEtA_41LV3JAvtMz3joaQ,3,If you have been to Toronto Dunn's; forget it. This is a different place; the only thing they may have in common is the name. Menu; prices; service; everything here is from another planet. Is totally worth a visit. ..I'll split this review in FOOD and SERVICE so it'll make more sense. ..FOOD: FIVE SHINY STARS..I was going to have something like a salad; but; it's a deli; right? Let's ask for their deli plate. For 12 bucks you'll eat until you'll explode (and I shared the plate with husband) and I had the most awesome cole slaw of my entire existence. The platter also includes cornichons; peppers; sausages; green tomatoes; bell peppers; bread; I'd say it's big enough for three. ..SERVICE: ONE FADING STAR; AND I'M BEING AWESOME..The service simply doesn't exist. I don't know why I had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated; as the place was EMPTY and there were at least three waiters working on something (cleaning? cashier?)  ..CONCLUSION: (5+1)/2=3 OK Stars. I could give bonus points for cheap and good drinks; but; nah. Serve me better next time; dude.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,UyeWPntJbCiivtpOkkuEcg,MzaYr1kGMJRzl1-5hJjKzA,5,So happy we found this gem while visiting this wonderful city. The combinations of flavors are mouth watering and just when you thought you couldn't fit anything else in your tummy...they have mini desserts; so you can enjoy a sweetie without bursting the dam. We will definitely be back before we depart.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,ku594gnolQNGCynS28L1XQ,o2FTyGsu3O-oeRgMKzUg_A,5,Well I did it; that is I went to both Schwartz's and Dunn's and now I need to determine which was better - for me at least;)..For me the meat at Schwartz's was better; not to say that Dunn's was bad- both top quality meats. ..I found the staff at Schwartz's more engaging with the customers - great for some; but sometimes you just want to spend some quality time with your significant others; so I'll call it a draw for staff...In terms of variety (aka non meat choices) Dunn's is king! At Schwartz's meat is your bundle!..I have to give Dunn's the edge on ambience as well - Schwartz's felt rushed...Bottom line if you are looking for a relaxed great meal Dunn's the winner ( also they have alcohol!!)
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,yX3YXM_ve3zzarXNKWENAA,IPWeM9Rv1jA1UmJjwWFBcA,3,Good smoked meat.  Can get full fat.  Do get full fat.  Fat.... mmm... fatty fatty fat fatt...
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,VPTIP7COdCLZdHSl66ZX3A,wHvZsBnLxoYjRQsmN_o6Mw,5,Tons of food. Come here after a long day; if you just need good; greasy food and don't care about nutrition. Seriously good bang for the buck! The fatty cuts are really delicious. I would strongly going with any meat dish. ..The poutine was okay. Nothing too special but not bad. I suppose I'm not the best judge but I've had a number of poutine dishes in Montreal and this one ranked middling. ..The slaw was good!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,PXWgNUtkp1B_KWMfaaJmHg,Q3IJWZYaKxFGGwiwqiTbXQ,4,I was told that Dunn's sandwich is a regional favorite and; if that's true; it's easy to understand why. I mean; wow. Perfectly cooked brisket with the right amount of smoke. Served on rye bread with a side of steak frites; cole slaw; and a pickle. I got the petit size but ordered the meat with more fat than lean. This is my idea of balance in life. :-) ..There's more than sandwiches on the menu  -- pizza; pasta; and burgers are served too. I was very pleased that I took the suggestion to try Dunn's.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,m0k4qKrajeg3libJmOSE3g,9Xu4ws8bT2E2gKS5SEgoCQ,5,Straight and to the point --- Totally delicious smoked meat sandwich. Don't care if its not the best rated by the connoisseurs of smoked meat. All you need to know is that its delicious and that matters more than the slight nuance of flavor differentiation the connoisseurs will bicker about. Nice atmosphere; huge portions and good wait staff even when it was busy. I went there twice during my 4 day trip!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,T2RyZACHEdEgd6ZQTejv_A,dLi4dJBwF62ba7tFPpYXuw,4,Delightful food and service...After checking in to our hotel; we wandered to Dunn's in late afternoon. Dunn's had a definite diner feel.  We were promptly seated in a tall backed booth.  We had different items grim their menu and all were tasty.  We did have smoked meat and it was good. My husband loved The vinegar based coleslaw. The service was also great.  They also have a kids' menu which was a nice change.  ..You won't be disappointed.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,qWFhKtzcHfbj6nCJwfTBiA,UVDU4mq9rScayyjUxWSrbw,4,Stopped here to try Poutine on our Montreal vacation.  Poutine was delicious with lots of cheese curds.  Pudding Choumeur was on my Montreal food bucket list so tried that for dessert as well.  Extremely rich and sweet.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,jnOd_dtTaAw0ggD3oAyb-A,pKluCLCX2u0DR-0qqPEjvw,2,Ate here last night. Have to say I was disappointed. We were seated right away but dinner took a while to arrive (30 min); which should not be the case for a restaurant of this style; in my view.  Food was ok; not super.  I had the smoked meat bagel.  It was acceptable but wouldn't seek it out again.  Experience was ruined by a chain-smoking lard ass on the patio table beside us.  Waiters didn't deal with the guy.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,7uVtymOX64IhnDjW_v1cmg,2UmqGDmhVsaoyRG4Gxs-Yw,5,I was told that their smoke meat fried rice is great. So I ordered one smoke meat fried rice and one smoke meat pizza. The smoke meat fried rice is ok; but I am impressed by the pizza. There are a lot of smoke meat on the pizza; it's so delicious. I will definitely go there next time and try other smoke meat dishes.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,TWVVfRKkFyoZMyujrQ0a5w,CdcWjugVJDQ74J3o6A4E7g,2,Little bit of a let down.  Had a very TGIFs feel.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,bMIcT5fbCtknlCeSoqjtPw,n0rU_Ra9krHZZ235G9aCAg,5,In Montreal for my wife's conference and I was alone with the kids for the day; so I finally had a chance to make my one wish happen and brought the kids here. It was late in lunch hour and was pretty crowded; but we were seated within 10 minutes. It's a nice enough place with a nostalgic deli/diner feel. Very narrow though. Our server was nice. The wait was tough with the kids; the kitchen was pretty backed up with the crowd. Eventually; the food did come. The kids enjoyed their chicken (smaller portion than I anticipated but it worked) and burger. I had a smoked meat Reuben. And holy cow; was that a lot of meat. It was a double decker. I was stuffed by the end; but the server asked if I didn't like it since there was so much left over. Do people normally finish this thing? It was a great meal; and crowdedness aside; it was an inviting diner and I totally understand the appeal. If I came back to town; I'd beeline for this place again.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,D-kao_LyrlEOIOR9EAf39g,TUMv2zfOuUjhSuVssAT-qw,4,Thought this was a great place for no frills Montreal / Canadian food. This place is popular enough but without the insanity of lines. We stopped by early in the afternoon on a weekend and were seated immediately. ..I got their reuben smoked meat sandwich and subbed out the fries for poutine (+$4); which was 100% worth it. At this point in my trip; I still haven't had any poutine. I probably should have gone with the la petite sandwich because I could only finish about 3/4 of my meal. The poutine was great and just as good as I imagined it would be. The smoked meat sandwich was good but not as good as the one I had a day earlier at another restaurant. The bread was a little too dry around the edges; so I ended up peeling off the crust. Overall; a good value and place to stop by if you want something casual and local.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,wbu2tX6Cc_oJpdz4ans0VQ,9r4zqduj2hV7xQD31IiI4g,5,had dinner here with parents. they are not used to cheese. We ordered chichen wings; famous smoked meat and fish n chips. a lot of food and big plate. delicious and is our favorite food in Montreal!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,vU7fP7uAWF3os-7woIQAXw,aLmJ6aZCGpogXFwL1MWlsw,3,The food is just okay but it's a Montreal institution so it is worth going to after a night out...Smoked Meat Sandwich - Not impressive but this is what they are known for and this is your cup of tea; then more power to you. Personally; I found it a bit bland though it was easy to eat. ..Poutine - This was much better. Completely unhealthy but a hearty option.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,PLx2Xn-MvOL2NSK2oOuOpA,3aYWRET9esczIvjp1_C2tQ,4,Dunn's is Dunn's.  Been coming here since the early 80's. Get the smoked meat sandwich..... medium with fat with a side of mustard and it more or less eats itself. It is a memorable event. Then to top it all off; the carrot cheese cake. If I were you; put Dunn's on your to do list for Montreal.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,zoA4G79atCGUpACqklty-Q,nVh_5cn-9YC__KmjPFbAyg,5,It was 4:30 pm when we arrived; tired and hungry after our long journey from out West. The dry airline pretzels our only sustenance up to now. ..The sign beckoned us; like a sign from A higher power; Dunn's Famous. I fell to my knees and wept; at long last; my precious. Montreal Smoked Meat. ..I spotted a sign from above Massage. Perhaps a massage while covered with smoked meat? One could only dream of such things. ..It was early enough in the day that we were quickly ushered to a quiet; out of the way booth at the back. I hoped the waitress wasn't offended by my inquiry about the meat massage. ..We ordered up a couple frosty pints and chugged them with reckless abandon; the memory of our meagre airplane fare still fresh in our minds. ..When hubby and I were married a blissful 10 years ago; he made a deal with a foodie. The deal was this; if I call sharesies then we are bound by matrimony to order things we could share so that no one person has to suffer by inadvertently ordering a lesser dish. And so it was; that we ordered the Super Combo Smoked Meat and Dunn's Famous Poutine. To share...The food arrived at a breakneck speed; I barely had time to check out the vintage photographs lining the hallowed walls...The food; ahhhh; the food! Tender and buttery soft smoked meat; ordered lean because hubby doesn't appreciate connective tissue and fat. Alas; that's one of the colossal responsibilities of sharesies; to take the other parties preferences into consideration. ..The delicately sliced meat was piled high; high; high; and nestled in between two little slices of incredibly fresh rye bread with a light smear of mustard. Nothing more was needed. A generous side of crispy fries; a saucer of fresh slaw and a slice of dill pickle. Perfection. Not one iota of pretension to be found...The poutine was perfect. Hot and tasty fries; fresh; melty cheese curds covered with gravy and topped with chopped Montreal smoked meat. Uncomplicated and flawless...Having lived my smoked meat foodie dreams; I believe I could die happy at this very moment. Except...we have 6 more days of culinary discoveries ahead. ..I was born for this moment.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,rIffoB5w3jbdMLiLCKNL_Q,GlGdBvZbMfYhuOeGAlBaow,4,We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table since we came during the heart of lunch hour. We sat at a table at the back of the restaurant. The server took awhile to get to our table. She served someone who was sat after us. We order a vegetable pizza and theclub roll with poutine (which is fries; cheese curds and gravy - a Montreal specialty) instead of French fries for an additional 4 dollars and a Molson beer. It was reasonable price. They accommodate my request for gravy on the side since my son does not eat meat and I wanted him to try the poutine. The small bathroom is located in the basement of the restaurant. I had to ask for the check are a while after our dishes were cleared.  The server did not come around to ask if everything was fine.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,ZXhRzUFOeyy_jkh0YMh_NQ,f_Greme3vi6rGUHazPHT0g,5,OMG! OMG! Poutine to the umpthess! holly molly this was amazesballz. the gravy was delicious; the fries were just right and the freaking smoked meat; uh yes sir; piled on top enough for two people to share and not get all pissy that someone ate to much.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,krt5huQg0Ke0BNZKABDK5Q,YJEzagCrER2jwKfxaBGcbw,3,Grabbed dinner after a movie on Christmas night. Food was tasty. Open Christmas was nice. Service OK. Somewhat annoyed that we were seated in a small booth with no coat hooks vs. the open; slightly larger booth next to it where they sat two people 30 seconds later. Small annoyance; but frustrating.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,IK_JralxuefW5UO21plWQg,3JUrfQwYTDc9YB2FXvlJPQ,4,I was in Montreal for medical tourism with family and this restaurant was right next to the pharmacy for their medicine.  I had to wait for prescription and was walking so I ate here right next door.   I had a thai salad with grilled chicken which was excellent and went back to buy a gift of a box of their smoked meat; frozen; and it is what we in the states call pastrami; really good; steamed up great; I will back to Montreal and Dunn's Famous!!!!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,MaWklnJJpqheLP2ePAIQeg,TLJZRmYLP4ksMM9UYDrMNA,5,Dunn's Famous in Montreal; QC is known for their smoked meat Sammmies; poutine; and cheesecake. ..Our waitress was helpful and said it was a $4 up charge to add poutine to our lunch special. We ordered the smoked meat on a sesame bagel (best sesame bagel with sesames embedded). It also came with coleslaw and a pickle. The poutine was in a bowl and big enough to split; which we did. The fries; gravy; cheese curds had a good flavor. The smoked meat Sammie was tasty too. We also shared a small cup of their homemade cream of potato soup. It was creamy but had chunks of potato. Delish!!.We sat outside and will definitely return when going back to good ol' Montreal!! Maybe we will try that famous cheesecake next time!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,R_dWE8zgvT6YFKQcxKb-YQ,9w9oHyscPzvueV9Lx-_2Gw,4,Delicious smoked meat sandwiches! Just lucked into this place the first afternoon in Montreal. Once we settled in of course we had to try the other famous smoked meat place who's name starts with an S. No comparison. This place wins has hands down.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,faUFMQe6Q7tPx4A3JxDfpA,9L9l2eMQFmirgGUTjQxOyg,5,It was -11 F (sorry; from the U.S.) outside and I wanted to go to schwartz's; but Dunn's was two blocks away. I'm a genius. The medium smoked meat on rye was comparable to katz's pastrami in NYC; maybe better; since there wasn't an ounce of fat on it but yet just as tasty. Got take out; but the dining space seemed nice and cozy.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,2TjLJ7HmBXKcWtHf1ebZpg,46PO99XJS3NjQnucRXpf7g,4,We ate here to try poutine; and the whole place was nothing special. The ice tea tasted like concentrate; the waiter was friendly but not over attentive..Poutine was o.k.; the fries were great and crispy and tasteful; but were unfortunately soaked by the watery-greasy gravy..We went again the next day; our new waiter was very nice and helpful; burgers were great and I could really enjoy the great fries! As we wanted to have desert; we were advised very well and even told which ones come frozen and which are freshly made (the first time I experienced this; left me stunned and slightly incredulous it actually happened). We chose to share a fresh apple pie and it was amazing! So turns out poutine is just not my thing; yet I can totally recommend Dunn's!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,iu7RXfqSzGfoO-58hd6yXg,XnMhv7yl4nZPhGD71LfJTQ,5,This was a religious experience. My boys and I tried various menu items including smoked meat sandwiches; poutine; smoked meat poutine. All were phenomenal and we will definitely lunch here again when the opportunity presents itself!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,x5YszwbIl3gYvuJTwM7c0Q,YZPPVdjnQr0sED59qrlrfQ,3,Food was okay;  don't know if staff was fried from weekend shifts or too much partying; but really bad service.  I don't know why it was so hard getting anyone attention.  Too much of antourist hot spot I guess.  Place was empty when I was there for early dinner.  Ruebens down the street much much better and doesn't look like it's still 1964. (Decor here very dated)..Too bad had high hopes; based upon local recommendations.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,vHk2_dbeWqTnL1sg_4OLqA,ic22bbulgA8SQmdAsixjRg,4,Dunn's; our go-to place for smoked meat... Maybe not so much anymore. We went on Valentine's Day and as usual; ordered the super smoked meat platter that costs about 18.00. Not long ago; some of the meat in the sandwich had to be removed and eaten with a fork because there was just too much of it and no mouth is that big! Alas; not so on our last visit. No problem biting into that sandwich; meat and all. How disappointing. Still; what little there was of it was good; as were the fries; cole slaw and  dill pickle. We have never had a problem with the service; it's always been friendly and fast.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,cLa5d91Fii2NyWNhJBOQ8Q,3,I rarely get smoked meat here; there is much better elsewhere...It does feel very tourist-y and the prices reflect that...The food is pretty solid; but you'd expect bigger portions considering the style of food..Burger's; Poutines; Pizza; Pasta; Wraps and Jewish types of foods like Matzoh Ball Soup and Karnatzel Sausages...This location is a bit cramped; but you're not spending an eternity here...On the plus side; they are open 24/7 and probably the closest sit-down restaurant next to the movie theater.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,6_po1mPKB9KtesYlOM7PWA,FEEpJ3mhqnSaSObjOkq18g,4,My family and I have been indulging in Dunns smoked meat for years now and the food has never let us down. The meat is so soft it falls apart in your mouth and the fries are fantastic. Order a smoked meat platter; drizzle some vinegar over your fries; eat and enjoy... We just came back from Montreal and it's been about 4 years apart from my last time here and I remember the portions of food being larger. Or was I just smaller? Nonetheless the smoked meat is the best around in my opinion and I highly recommend grabbing a plate of Montreal's finest when you visit the city...Also be sure to try a piece of their famous strawberry cheesecake!
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,_pIe6T7Yw4rtHMMGW1o-Lw,FBNkujgBpnRXcfDp38FNZg,4,Visited this place based on the other reviews.  With the stress on smoked meat we were a little leery but decided to try it since it was a Montreal tradition.  Anyways we should not have been worried; it exceeded expectations.  The restaurant; like Montreal; is from another era.  For both the city and the restaurant this is a good thing.  ..We were seated very quickly and frankly it took more time for us to read the menu than it did for the food to be delivered.  We ordered the large platter and asked that the fries be converted to poutine.  Bear in mind that smoked meat is basically pastrami.  This is very good pastrami.  For the most part it was very lean and tender.  The platter was served with several pieces of white bread which we used to build sandwiches with mustard.  In retrospect we should have ordered it with the melted swiss cheese though it was plenty good without it.  We ordered a second and there was none left when we were done...With regard to the poutine it was very good.  It was not as salty as other places which is just as well since you can add that to taste. ..We will visits again when we are next in Montreal.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,IHhKyP-3DredQPDMnOazXA,XC34SWq0WWnwghDkLm01Uw,3,The smoked meat sandwich I had was excellent; it was basically like a corned beef sandwich if you are unfamiliar. Also the french onion soup I had the next day was good too. Lots and lots of gruyere!..The place was just kind of dark and greasy though. The general ambiance kind of depressed me. Would love one of those sandwiches right now though...
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,P2yl-VsSevKD5w4Wv3Og6Q,Jfy6ruLUGzFZeLxNuvaBQg,4,It's like Denny's in the states; but they have poutine and smoked meat! What else do you expect service wise? Definitely hit the spot late night/early morning after going out. Service is typical of any 24/hr coffeshop type of joint.  Completely acceptable imo.
kpuMEGNsjD4R5VnJa8IWTw,JcYdKrYen3ZOz56Vg3iLjA,pxE3KLqwKC11Qv1dDhy-yA,5,I freely acknowledge that my five-star rating may have a little to do with the fact that I haven't had good poutine in years. But even if they didn't have poutine; Dunn's would be worth a visit for their smoked meat sandwich -- the way it melts in your mouth is just heavenly. (Why the Quebecois can't just call it 'pastrami'; I don't know.)
Ktw2LiHK6Ipthw0ua3B16w,S_qq4WiJgaxgmdclopDXvw,rtRDIrvZmgQqRBoHWxC0Gw,5,Wow; Terra Verde; located in the convention center; is quite a find!  The food is delicious and was ready quickly.  ..Terra offer breakfast and lunch and are open most weekends.  I didn't expect to find food this good in the convention center and was quite surprised at how delicious the chicken is.  I have also overheard that the fish is delicious too.  They offer a wide variety of salads and other healthy foods for lunch; in addition to a full breakfast menu.  ..The service was great; and everything was done with a smile.  I'm definitely eating here again if the chance arises.  ..Also - they are one of the only restaurants in the area to accept American Express.
Ktw2LiHK6Ipthw0ua3B16w,AqLuNLhPuzhGiUf7CbbcGg,VO4H6hRn31p0nRrBh7mDNQ,5,A great meal; excellent quality ingredients makes for super quality served up with an honest friendly and no nonsense service. Great quality; great service; great experience well done team terra verde
Ktw2LiHK6Ipthw0ua3B16w,UQb7UbjuNRwL1bCJKl7sEA,nw-rMuIjhkZ6_k47Lj3itA,4,This place is located in the Palais des Congres de Montreal. It serves paninis; pizza; salad; and some cooked caseroles of meat. I had several paninis here and they all tasted good. The chicken soup was just OK. It's a smal eatery and it can get crowded during a convention. Come early if you can. The staff was generally courteous and accommodating. They accept America Express cards.
Ktw2LiHK6Ipthw0ua3B16w,cnwibyrgppG-AEH5Ju7Bvg,3derm2byN9DsA7kHbQmsLQ,5,Cute little cafe in the Palais des Congres. The owner was a bit aggressive bringing us in; but in a friendly way. Mostly they serve pizzas and sandwiches with a selection of salads/sides; but they also had veggie quiche. The cafe is very clean and modern; and they employees are friendly and very helpful...We tried the veggie quiche; pepperoni pizza; and cheese w/spinach pizza with the beet salad; veggie salad. The quiche is a big portion; tastes great; and had a really good texture. Was really happy they warmed it up in the oven so it was nice and warm all the way through. The pepperoni pizza was like a pizza bread moreso than an actual pizza; but it was yummy nonetheless. The spinach and cheese pizza was like a flat bread they warm up in the oven then fold over like a taco. Tasted pretty amazing :). The sides were equally good--especially the beet salad (but I might be biased lol). ..Overall a great; convenient spot if you're in the area :)
Ktw2LiHK6Ipthw0ua3B16w,JPX475DBszy6QLDtke9S5Q,nXYJrAxpcgURGRLZZBZ3vQ,5,A lovely and unexpected treat in the convention center; and the owner's charm and helpfulness made it that much better.

lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,plOtZruZJ-rxF7VCgeS40A,_4dS0GsBPA90NkYuQD5oFw,4,The house brown ale was okay; the stout on the rotating selection was amazing.  It's nothing that outlandish; but the service is good; and it's a good place to get some beers; poutine; and pub food.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,y_gm01u44M2P7y_nZk6WtA,E7xEDRHc9BdHNyX0BpXYYQ,1,Not a good time. We were seated upstairs; which was fine. We ordered drinks & food. My buddy's Rum & Coke included a screw. After reporting it (and explaining that we didn't want anything comp'ed) we were given a stare-down by their security from across the bar while the manager & waiter discussed the situation. No idea how a screw got into his drink. ..Food was ok; normal pub food. I didn't try the beer; which is likely the draw for this pub. We ate & left feeling like we weren't welcome.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,7Vrhq8d87KYxy0VcQjRVXQ,zPfghNN_aqEckbYJsl9Gbg,3,After wandering around on a bitterly cold Saturday in Montreal; my friend and stopped in Les 3 Brasseurs.  We needed something to eat after a few hours at the museum; and to refuel for our outdoor walking sessions...While walking along Rue Saint Paul as most tourists do; we found this place abuzz with activity.  We figured what better way to fuel our caloric needs on such a cold day than with beer and poutine.  I mean; that is what you do when you're in Canada; isn't it?..My companion went with the poutine; and I actually opted for the cheddar soup in a bowl.  I strange choice on my part (I'm not usually into creamy soups); but I felt compelled to have something different and a bread bowl also sounded very appetizing.  I was happy with my decision.  It was exactly what I needed that day.  And did I mention the beer?  We went with the blondes - a perfect choice for me.  As a non-beer drinker; I was pleasantly surprised by this light beer.  There was absolutely no bitterness to it whatsoever; and that's exactly what I had hoped for...Les 3 Brasseurs was in the perfect place at the perfect time for us.  We normally wouldn't have ventured into a chain restaurant; but as standards; this wasn't bad.  We had a nice time; the food was good; we were warm. Our server was polite; but I did feel that we were rushed out a little sooner than we would have liked.  A crowd was starting to fill in near the door; and that was our indication to hurry up instead of linger over our beers for a few minutes longer.

The bartender was fairly attentive; but kept pressuring us to order food. I'm not sure why; but he asked about 3 times and even though I said we weren't hungry yet; he put the order in anyway. Well; since the poutine was there we ate it and it was decent. The beer was good too; this place is kind of a microbrewery; I later found out that it's a small chain with locations in Ontario and Québec...Good place if you're looking for a normal sports bar and just want to relax for a bit.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,p8UvRhYqhg0djH4HYyoc9A,G33ZxFYX6P9Vre1Y3THQXg,4,Amazing prices. Good poutine; and a great beer selection! I got a flight which was a great chance to taste a lot of the beers. My boyfriend got a 36 oz IPA which ended up tasting a lot like an amber ale; we actually thought they messed up the order at first; talked to the waitress and she ended up repouring the same beer..It was a decent beer; just not what an IPA should be! They also let me make a substitution on my flight which was nice. We got the waffle for dessert; highly recommend! Solid place for food and drinks; especially if you are looking for good deals. We were amazed at the food and drink prices there. We got all of our drinks and food for $26 USD! Insane. Coming from Boston; that is unheard of. We were pleased with our experience!
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,E1X2Ah0j1NDCvlw40EZm2Q,rJwP9n5JYuo97ex_e-nVcA,1,It makes no sense to go there if you don't speak French. They put all attention to French speaking customers and ignore English speaking customers. Even if English is your 5'th language. Food is OK but beer is actually quite bad. Tastes like water.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,lKbwTDmxrnIPBfw0SlEdrw,uBsL1bFQa5GSNqfxdHguOw,4,Tasty beer. Very friendly bar staff..  I quite like the duck confit poutine as well..
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,vEfByor7SkYsk-Egh09F-g,BcbLh7B5aFtI4k3xE1Kzsw,4,Brasseur special flat bread pizza was delicious; blonde and white beer was good too . Nice decor/atmosphere as it was located in old Montreal building.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,kwjfwrE4Qs6ZblePxNeQcQ,amI7TJAvYgkxp4VPueAwFg,3,Ok; this is a chain. Normally; we try to avoid chains when we travel but it was hot and we just wanted a beer. Well; they definitely have beer here. It's not great beer; but it's beer. I ordered the Brown and it wasn't bad. My bf ordered the IPA and it wasn't bad either. I feel like this is probably a good place to take people that are not fully into craft beer but they dabble or you're trying to convert them from the mainstream stuff...We didn't order food; but it looked good as it came out when other people ordered it. We sat at the bar and the bartender wasn't very friendly at all. In fact; I wanted to order another beer but he was kinda rude and I didn't want to tip him more than I had to. Oh; and also he never really checked back in with us so when we finally got his attention we were annoyed and just wanted to close out...This place served its purpose.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,B6kHo5Bfik1kAK7SFtYtCg,-goff0Gyj6Tf06R2VRTp5g,3,The beer was above average; but definitely not a top notch craft brewery. Food was mediocre. We ordered the poutine; tandoori chicken pizza; pulled pork sandwich; and a couple of the pasta salads. None of the foods really stood out as exceptional and it was hard to finish everything (not because of the quantity). Of the other options in the vibrant part of Old Montreal; definitely not a place to which I would come back for seconds.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,m5b84-nPPVNLlDtZyVGZ3w,3iKpAL1axl_pnHXhhEibxg,2,Pretty lame service (girl who just cleans behind the bar could stand to smile once in a while); overpriced drinks; none of the beer is really good; the beer cocktails were so weak; and even though they only have 6 beers they were out of one.  Great location though.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,ht1s75X-Nzaj8pA9tFVCvw,TxBbtpNwMDirWNXZT9AktA,4,my love for now. every time pass by; want to have a drink here. good place for afternoon relax.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,pIzVI1vxQ8_P5VwP9ZLqCw,NR94X7bFtjskr4wp1Hl2oQ,5,Great pub had a few really tasty beers before we went to dinner.  Pepe was an awesome barkeep; friendly staff good beer and fun place to imbibe some local brews.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,A1KW5YLXdhvLIYDhN76tGw,qb864yeY0H83RwC_WPw57g,2,I'm sure excellent meals have been served here; however; the day that I visited was definitely NOT one of them. My husband and I ordered Poutine as a starter and found it okay. You could definitely tell the fries were of the generic food service variety; and the gravy tasted as if it came straight from the jar. My husband ordered the pork shank and mash and was definitely let down. There was far more inedible fat and connective sinews than actual meat. I ordered the peppy pizza which was okay but wound up picking most of the pepperoni off because it was filled with hard gristle! I really wanted to give them a decent review; and I'm sure that other locations in MTL are decent; however; this one just didn't hit the mark- at all.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,1ilY-t6ZToGpe7mEMWSppA,cgegHwvbFcEfmilDnNhccA,4,This place was fun. As seemed to be the tradition in Montreal the service was slow. The place was pretty empty when we stopped by and the wait staff seemed to be doing their own thing on their own schedule. That's pretty much how it seemed everywhere we stopped in the city. I had the Amber beer they brew (it's a micro brew) and it was great. A full huge pint on a warm day was great. Also tried the blonde which I didn't find as good as the amber ( that sounds awkward). I had a southwest type wrap and once it go out it was VERY good as were the fries. I really enjoyed this place. If you're in the area; find one give the beers a try and the food; they go well together.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,aWtu___qHpNxAwd6SwDcGQ,3,Walking along Old Montreal; we decided to stop here for some drinks. ..We didn't expect much in terms of service since we were in a touristy; loud; busy bar; we just wanted our order to come when it's supposed to come...We had the 4-oz glasses of beer with different flavours and the blonde beer; which were both decent. Service ended up being okay; as we actually had a good conversation with one of the bartender ladies. However; it was simply too loud and too crowded for my party to enjoy our drinks that we decided to leave as quick as possible after we're done.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,z2AqDVI4UZ_CT7gf2panBg,XSyP_Ae2TteWtnaorGuNoQ,2,I sometimes get dragged here by co-workers. Average beer (sometimes served too warm); variable quality food (fries are always yummy though); slow but friendly service. ..Sometimes the floor vibrates; it's irritating.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,ZEmaLJ0CMDqb4DobyZDMvg,GMkvwJnMaHE0d22rpRVGFg,4,Very good tasting beers. The blonde and amber were very good. The IPA was not as hoppy as us west coasters are use to but still very approachable. Don't leave here without trying the Poutine! Fantastique. Staff is very friendly and helpful.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,CZccZMTqJgPoQxTBFxQ91A,vmpJZ1oC7imBIsX6Aj2L3w,2,Subpar poutine. Fries were pretty disgusting actually. Beer was nice. Service was absolutely terrible. I sat for 20 mins with nobody coming to take my order; and sat for 20 more trying to pay. Probably will never come back
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,SWiWJ01uvLNvC08zoof2FA,2BEqccqMHuy7bwue1ds1rA,4,Loved this place. We wandered in after a day of exploring the city and had to wait a bit for a table outside. The location was perfect and the food was excellent. The best part of the meal was the beer which was unique and flavorful. The service was quite slow so I don't know if this is a place to go if you're in a rush. Great casual restaurant in the heart of picturesque Old Montreal.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,oTGqaMk7G_x-XHmGOWo9zQ,QiD9EbjWULfzImJuzWZimg,4,Try as we might; humankind cannot live on beer alone. So; order the maxi fries. I drankkk my firssst liter size IPA beeeeerrrrr and cu; cu; could not beee more haapppy.  Seriously; the smoked Rueben sandwich although not as smoky as I had hoped for; tasted great. The service was spot on; the staff; friendly and attractive even before the drinking began. .My birthday and the excuse to watch the world cup had me coming back; 3 times over the weekend.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,rSmzJWksglpkxZjen9KgGw,6M11RdXCVHpNQu35xyzcJw,2,This was a bit of a disappointment for me; craft brew restaurants are something I love and try to frequent as much as I can. .The beers were good not great but the food I ordered was a disappointment. I had to poutine with BBQ beef which is a favorite for me and a real treat when I am home. While I can not say it was bad (it was just ok) it was however cold. When you can't keep gravy and fries hot I wonder what else is not happening in a kitchen; I tend to assume nothing good so probably won't be back.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,jfUTkA8sIhiw5ahn9-9HPg,BW9ro93uFg3jcokUjGX6sA,3,Malgré le fait que ce soit une chaîne; ce qui enlève le caractère unique du restaurant; c'est une place très conviviale pour y passer une soirée entre ami ou avec sa tendre moitiée!.Il y a souvent du monde (preuve d'une bonne appréciation de l'endroit?! A chacun de juger...) ce qui rend l'endroit encore plus convivial! On est certain de parler sans que le voisin n'entende toute la conversation; ce qui procure une sensation d'intimité préservée..Très bon souvenir!
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,MZyMY-nW2ChwIs7ZhELOTQ,gWejgSATWclVv7EqwL0YVg,4,Just went tonight with coworkers as we're staying right in the area; apparently both of them had been here before and thought of it fairly highly. Food was good; I had the lamb shank which was pretty well done for a brewpub. Beer was also pretty tasty as well; especially the seasonal porter and the regular wit. Service was pretty friendly so I would come back.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,jcsfcCjyP9xzgR_DamsUFw,7btUbReo5dBEv0jEvsYDuw,4,Really popular. Arrived around 12 am; and filled with people. Ordered hamburger and waffles. Hamburger is not so suitable for me. But waffles are not bad. Great beire.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,RVagGrcHdy1HB7-_c9ywZQ,EW0EYSjxsYP85XI8EcI7gg,5,I can get down with any place that touts themselves as a brewery. I like beer and anyone that loves a pint. My dad and I walked back to the hotel and saw this lively brewpub and decided to stop on in...Les 3 is beautiful. It's large and well lit. The decor leans on the darker side but it's still very inviting. The front area is anchored by the bar and overhead beer vats (in lieu of chandeliers). In the back there's more seating...My dad and I grabbed two seats at the bar and found our lifelong Canadian dilemma: low ABV beers! I can't knock any brewery or restaurant for this. I think it's a Canadian thing; but it's still disappointing! I'm a good drunk I swear!..I eventually decided on their Amber (always my safe bet) while my dad went with a wheat style. Our bartender; John Pierre-Paul (probably butchered his name so I apologize in advance) was super friendly and told us of his life in France and how Montreal is better. ..The only reason I didn't visit them as much as La Cage during my trip was their lack of tvs. This was a hockey road trip and I needed to watch as much as possible. It's a shame because their food looked bomb and I loved the atmosphere; but hockey was the main focus and I wanted to watch it. When I come back to Montreal I'd definitely be down to visit again; but just know if you're as hockey crazed as I am there's only a couple TVs and they're in the corners.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,4tnd3k-foRbvHLNCHVUEdA,EHMCDUyF_9IpzLh8ar4V7Q,2,The ambience of Rue St Paul's cobblestones and sidewalk musicians are a beautiful draw on a sunny day...My burger was very dry; a compressed ..A very traditional poutin was wasted on the oil used for for French fries; which needs a change. ..I had to ask for everything (plate; condiments) even though our waitstaff could see we were sharing food instead of individual orders. And the trainer with my waiter beer blocked my request for a sample. ..I mean it's an okay place but not a return for me; unless  I'm in the areaI; I might stop for a beer.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,Hmx8TNO3Dsq2GGScqLS1bA,Sl6Hg9iSVtTennb9_imjEA,3,Stopped at this cute little place in the old town. Got a table adjacent to the pedestrian-only street. Had a very thin crust pizza; a Caesar salad; and a deep pour of Cabernet. Both were nicely done and were good for a quick bite. Service was a little bit slow; but then it was quite busy; so to be expected. They had a large pub inside; though we would always opt for some good people watching along the street. Fun lunch spot!
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,iYwvHpgiLqBX2dFJhx7zBQ,n2mN1ulPID5eUgqJjIvhDQ,5,This is a great place to grab a few brews when strolling around Old Montréal. ..No doubt it exists for the tourists; but when I visited I'd say I was the only tourist in the entire building. I visited around happy hour and everyone else was wearing business suits/dresses and speaking French. So don't let the touristy location deter you. Apparently nine-to-five Montrealers go here too...From the outside it doesn't look like much; but it's really impressive once you step inside. Inside; there's a main circular bar; a back room; and even a second balcony level that overlooks the first level. I was surprised to learn that Les 3 Brasseurs is a franchise in Montréal because it doesn't seem like a typical franchise. They did a great job in transforming the old building into a unique; fun; and lively brew pub...I didn't stay very long because my car's meter was running low; but I would definitely return again. Speaking of parking; be careful with parking on the street. My bartender informed me the city is very serious about ticketing expired meters.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,xYFHd-QrTj3A22wJsT6OCg,E5oRLRWQLyCNrcJ9UEfwSA,4,Max is a great waiter and the la belle province is great! Atmosphere is also great :)
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,balrBCo_Y9_H7i_w3tdC1A,treYpE8wLfbxtv97Zo9DoA,4,This is my third time to a 3B and I find there quality of food; beer and service very dependable. ..This last time I had a group of 11 with me.  Checked earlier in the day if they could accommodate us later and they took our reservation--even let me pick out a spot.  ..Sure enough our table was waiting and the service by Vincent and the whole staff couldn't have been more effeicient.  We had a Cirque show to catch at the Old Port; do it was a perfect location in Old Town.  Plus; when I told the staff our time limit and we were all paying seperately; there was no eye rolling or attitude.  (America really needs to adapt the portable card machines!). ..Excellent menu selection for pub food plus fare.  I enjoyed a Smoked salmon/shrimp flammenkuken.  Delicious...I really recommend this place for some pub flare with style.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,A_L2MMaZDWLBQRwp8JWzyw,Zc_r0dSRlM35VnKKYYH-2A,4,Enjoyed after dinner beers at the bar: the Brown was delicious. Nice atmosphere on a Sunday evening - busy but not obnoxious.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,ITYYCq0KYV3PIwHx-7WL_A,LOM6O4aL0sOV5P4yNq5szw,4,We enjoyed our time here. It's very similar to your standard US sports bar. We went on a Friday night and it was bustling; but not packed. Not out of this world; but better than the other sports bars near by. Food was good and so was the beer. What more could you ask for? I can see why there are several of these around the city. I think this place should get a 3.5; but since that's not an option I was swayed to round up.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,CjG9Mqr26HvNBs-RqfWwBw,JPw3YaL0kLRKZIKVzVd2Rg,1,Food was decent; beer was cold; but service ... ended up with a bad server that is in to arguing with his customers. ..Came for happy hour - $5 beers between 3-6pm. ..We ordered our first beer at 3:10pm. Got the final check to leave at 4:35 and the beers were charged starting at $6.50 each. When we contested; he said we ordered before happy hour stared. Even when we ordered our second beers around 3:40 he said they didn't count because he said we placed our first order before 3pm. Never heard anything like this before. ..We knew the time when we sat and ordered because we came specifically for happy hour. But the waiter argued with us threateningly and we were pressured to pay the bill as is.  ..Won't be going back. .Too many other nice places nearby with better service where they don't threaten the customer and where we don't get ripped off.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,aFi9UE5mbZX9VUr1dkzETw,Kll2OXAovYGvisMeVCHT4w,5,There was a mixup between myself and their corporate party scheduler.  I showed up at 5:45 to get ready for my party of 200 at 6.  They were getting ready for a party of 60 at 7!  (if you're reading this; sorry!)..I don't know how they did it; but they got everything ready; my party didn't go hungry or thirsty; and a great time was had by all.  The food is good pub grub; the beer is very good; and the service; having been able to handle that kind of radical change in such a short period of time; was incredible.  The people working that night were all stars; and I can't thank them enough!
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,uGaI6KTqO6Fk_zwKY4tESQ,LQXWl_hvRjBXnlzQtV-xJg,4,Very good food and drink on a rainy Tuesday afternoon. Reasonable prices for lunch and quick service from friendly staff who did not poo-poo us when we did not speak French.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,9he2M-Zmsq2x56TLHFtuUA,18N4yh6o-wTTe6mReEbapQ,3,We ate lunch here on New Year's Day when most other restaurants were closed. The food was decent but service was fair. Our waitress forgot to put in our appetizer order which wasn't that big of a deal; but overall not great service.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,QNoV3zbwNDYm4O9R9Aua3w,F_ci7HMb02G03PQ3Ck4ulQ,2,Good beer; mediocre food; poor service.. so many other spots nearby that are far superior...
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,tifEtPrUgGAnHRi03DRUlQ,Ir9BTJ0lrn1SCCu7akQyfw,4,No matter what city I go to; priority #1 is finding local breweries or brew pubs. Not only does Les 3 Brasseurs have an extensive beer menu; they offer poutine with several different topping choices. The menu also features colored dots next to each item to assist with been pairing; something that is VERY rare in my experience.Sitting right in the heart of Old Montreal; it was busy; but it was easy to get a seat for lunch on a Saturday afternoon in March. ..If you take nothing else from this review; take this: GET THE BEER-BATTERED MAXI FRIES! Whether it's in your poutine or as your side; make the upgrade; you will not regret it. All of the food we had was great. My flammekueche (basically a flatbread) was wonderful; my wife's burger was a little overdone; and our friends were pleased with their choices...Order a beer flight; and make sure you get the neighborhood and feature brews. These are the major point of interest about the company as they try to keep up the tradition of every town/location having it's own beer (something I noticed very much in action when I was in Germany last year). ..This is a fun; family-friendly; laid-back brewpub where I could have easily eaten every day: lunch; dinner; or late-night. les 3 Brasserurs will definitely feature in future trips to Montreal.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,eNvHcq1dORJJl-6YwNnihw,_dXiOgPcMeKUrh6QBrSAHw,3,We came here after eating dinner nearby to grab a beer.  We tried a couple of different beers and enjoyed both.  At first we sat outside; which was perfect as we wanted to do some people watching in the Old Town on our first night in town.  We were told we had to order food to sit out there; so we ordered a pizza even though were weren't hungry and then ended up eating half of it anyway.  It was better than expected.  We moved inside at around midnight and continued drinking at the bar.  This place was pretty rowdy and seemed to attract a lot of younger; heavy drinkers.  Exactly the place I would have loved when I was a student!  Not exactly the place a couple of 30-something married ladies want to go to catch up after not seeing each other in months.  ..This place is great for large groups; younger more boisterous people or anyone looking for a nice beer selection in a busy bar.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,0Jxvm6vGiiEvfOcAA3Mk3A,9T3Bu-n-FqvYmYgYENDOrg,4,Visited from New York and decided on this restaurant!  The poutine was quite good and served as a great appetizer.  I recommend getting the poutine with house fries.  The difference is definitely real!  If I ever make the trip back to Montreal; I will more than likely visit 3 Brasseurs again.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,BXAZB-k-NDKcFRPleYF7GA,8SMCow4u0a_TMtdL3P_g1Q,3,We went company event here.  Fixed menu and drink coupons so not a perfect experience.  The servers were not very good.  They seemed unhappy and it felt weird.   The food was mediocre.  The chicken salad was hard to eat.  The burger was olk.  The pizza was good.  I think the staff made it hard.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,lFk1-yVlMCDq9h23eQrcyw,TVplxXIH57GKAdW9ju4fGQ,4,My boyfriend and I came here a couple of times to eat and a couple of times for drinks while we were in Montreal. It was within walking distance of our hotel and offered up an affordable and fast place to eat and enjoy a delicious beer. Would recommend.

lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,s6DpH7UE-fMhXiQHzD3K1Q,_viGAXMEJ2pg72b8-OAojA,5,This was my second time in Montreal; the first time I went I visited a Les 3 Brasseurs at a different location and loved it. Loved it so much I went again this time around and I loved it even more so I had to write a review!.Amazing regardless of any location; all of them must be amazing. Excellent food; excellent service. Great recommendations from the server. My boyfriend and I shared the 3B Poutine which was incredible. We shared the Moulin Rouge which was also amazing. We also shared the fried calamari which was great; the aioli that came with is was also unbelievable. My boyfriend had a beer and isn't a big fan of beers; i believe he had Le Blanche; but he loved it he said it was so great. I would definitely go back here time and time again. So happy there are a few locations in Toronto where I'm from so I won't only have to go when I'm in Montreal!!
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,k-WpAGk9-LFJyONecDneqQ,pt8rKBpk2tuQB-ZNnXUf5g,4,I visited Montreal for the weekend; and I came here for dinner one night.  It's a nice sports bar with a pretty decent menu.  The food was ok.  I had the spicy sausage and olives flammekeuche which is like a french; thin crust pizza.  I had the chili poutine; too.  This was very good - just like chili cheese fries.  The brie burger was also pretty good.  They make all the beers on site; so I got a flight.  The white beer was my favorite!  The service was good; too.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,j6Kv_wLQzZMWobLIyijX3A,db_RHqaw_d4H7LlEDaLmJg,4,Good brewpub.  The dark beer was tasty and well-flavoured with a pleasant acidity.  The flammekuechen (flatbread pizzas) were tasty and filling - I enjoyed the smoked meat version...Nice place for lunch after wandering around Montreal's Old Town on a cold day.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,G4pldo-BydSCGg_-6f9C9g,wo_w-nqFKopYkncZ4U1yLQ,3,I was looking for a good micro brewery in Montreal and this place was it.  The beer here is excellent but I have to say the food could've been better.  The thin crust pizza is a little bland and not as fresh/hot as it should be. The fries were oilier than I preferred.  The atmosphere here is very nice.  They have a bar area where you can have your lunch and interact with the fellow patrons.  Its also great for large groups especially if your friends like beer and are loud.  I had a pint of their brown ale and it was excellent.  Try their et cetera which gives you 4 beers to sample.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,i6w1V5iPWdYKVPnZLOeLkA,lRbqrI5SW0_R42T1IAigyw,4,This is like the equivalent of a TGI Friday's for me...but its old town location gives it a lot more character than a Chili's would have in the States.  I came here on my first night in MTL and ordered their Light Blonde beer; a regular poutine and a smoked meat Flamm (a very thin crust pizza with a cream sauce).  The place was packed for a hockey game; despite this we grabbed a table right away and a lovely waitress greeted us quickly.  She brought us English menus and drinks right away.  The beer was good and the poutine (with maxi fries) turned out to be my favorite during my stay!  And I did my share of poutine tasting....from super high-end to not so much; and this one took the prize (sorry French-Canada!).  The Flamm was not my favorite; but the beer and poutine filled me up; so it wasn't a big deal.  If in a bind for a place to dine; this is not a bad bet.  It really doesn't feel so chain-like.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,iRH5zaVgqX3wYxhLXOYhNw,sjh0v6WVgbuOgnzhCcPQsg,2,My girlfriend used to love trois brasseur; until they recently changed the menu. They removed the best burger ever; the portobello burger! We will probably go again for a beer but I don't think we will order a meal there ever again.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,OKUs_ZvoDYkgg-bFRfmHCg,bHHvEqzDvjm4DBxiboH7jg,5,This review is from a tourist's and first time visitor to Montreal's point of view. My husband and I were staying in a hotel around the corner; and this place was recommended to us since we wanted some local beer; as we hear Montreal is known for! ..As someone who knows about 3 words in French; I was thankful that there was a menu in English; and the woman who served us spoke English very well. ..The poutine was excellent (my first one)! I was dying for some vegetables after a long day of airport food; so I just had a caesar salad; which tasted much like any other Caesar salad you've ever had. My husband had a burger; and he thought it was great. ..I'm not much of a beer drinker; so I tried the rasp-beer-y lemonade; which has a very light beer in it; but you couldn't taste it at all. It was amazing! I bet it is an awesome choice in the summer. My husband was very impressed with the large beer selection; and liked the few he ordered...The vibe was very relaxed; and on a weekday night there wasn't a huge crowd. We came back with some friends over a weekend and there were a lot more people. We sat at the bar; had a drink; and watched a game. There are a lot of tv's and is a great place to watch sports...Free wi-fi!..We had two great experiences here. It was a fun place to go. I'm not sure what locals think if it; but I would recommend checking this place out if you're visiting and looking for a place to chill.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,tIC17kquryWRs_KyHEz8JQ,ELdPmYO0u3ASOSkqj1xbkg,3,Came out one night for a beer.  We split a pitched of the amber ale; which was pretty good I suppose.  We had some maple syrup whiskey called Sortilege that was out of this world good!  Def try it.  I ordered the French Onion soup.  It had green onions sliced up in the soup itself; which was different.  Otherwise it was pretty bland; almost to the point that I needed to add salt.  The bartender was lovely.  They have two menus; French and English; which was nice as well.  I was just sum it up by saying that it wasn't anything great; but not bad.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,DbXrdIchmaeEp5ajsjog7g,zt5aK82R6xgCI_7cGP75rA,3,Three starts because of the customer service. We came here because our hotel concierge recommended this place. We were seated at the bar and the staff behind the bar didn't greet us until a couple of minutes later. And then I had to get up to where the bar tender was speaking with his friend to order our beer. Bad service the staff definitely needs training.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,KE3fPgfxEmfsutKxMlssvQ,Sb320YR8TcgLvIT1KvHO-g,4,People give it a hard time because it's a chain; but the simple fact is; they have a DELICIOUS white beer (among others) and the vibe is always good.  Even if it's not the kind of place you'd spend a whole night at; nothing wrong with watching the game; hammering back some massive glasses of beer; and eating a flammekueche...I'm a fan; screw the haters
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,-El08WpCw4A5kxrJ7lrHmA,5S2aJfnTtofU9vDK_eCZxA,1,The service was excellent. That's where the positives end. Tried the 6 beer sampler since I like microbrews and enjoy trying a wide variety. I could not stomach any of them. All were very yeasty and just plain awful. The IPA had barely a hint of hops; and the red and stout were also incredibly sweet as well as yeasty.  The food was underwhelming as well. All had potential; but then poorly executed. ..Did I mention the service was great?  And yes; that's where they were successful. They should abandon the idea of brewing their own beer or hire someone who knows how to brew something worth drinking. Generally microbrews are rich and complex and enjoyable. I can't even think of a word to describe how awful these are.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,ANwQJyWJBF_atfpBBLshaQ,3XznbbnGnxFbd65QW38aHQ,1,For being in a tourist area no one seems to be very good at customer service. I stood at the bar just to ask a question about if we seat ourselves or wait to be seated. After standing there for 10 minutes no one acknowledge us and I proceed to ask at the bar. The bar tender just stood there and then started helping other people after making eye contact with me several times. ..Very bad customer service. Will never go back.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,LQ4FYt_RV8ikqFGKWgxNbg,7Agml8HMlte79lRNhDxtwQ,4,Parfait pour finir la soirée; tout ce qu'il faut pour boire et manger. Le service est bien dans l'ensemble. Les télés diffusent les chaînes sportives. Ce n'est ni ma première; ni ma dernière visite.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,_PutE0_1mFBUGm939UV_NA,NvU4pchu5IKvyVY6AxPOaw,4,Went looking for a casual place to have dinner and a beer and found Les 3 Brasseurs. It was one of the more inviting places on Rue St-Paul on a chilly rainy night. It wasn't crowded but did seem to be an after work hang out for some locals. ..The service was good. I enjoyed the beer of the week. It was something between the regular blonde and amber. Love that it came in 1 liter mugs. Food was pretty good too. Had the poutine with pulled pork on top to start. Then a burger that was fresh and pretty tasty. Next time I would get the poutine without the pork. ..All in all it was good and I would certainly go again.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,UIYekmecs_Sb3MQdUmFGXg,e9624UdZgQzLS11RPTYxaw,1,Steam trays usually keep prepared food warm without soaking the primary ingredients in moisture.  This is the secret to most secondary and hospital food preparation. Shared; no doubt; by the good people at Golden Corral. How Les 3 Brasseurs manages to put out dish after dish of room temperature; slightly wet sandwiches and burgers; is a miracle of ineptitude. It staggers the imagination that this location is almost constantly full during lunch and holiday months; and it fails to attempt to produce any memory other than that of being ripped off in a noisy; child-filled environment that plays offensively bad music and mind-numbingly stupid videos (are these house made; as well?). ..Stay far away from the rock hard soft pretzels and the rueban sandwich and the mystery meat burgers. The beer is often decent. The shrimp; when warm; can reach the rarified heights of a Northern Ohio Abblebys mid-management change. Ask for anything fresh and warm before placing an order; if you must go here. That way you have an out if you need to; and you will need to; send something; or everything back.  Verdict: the back of house is a shambles...All that being said; I found that the servers are always very nice; hardworking and professional and; again; if you need a fresh beer; and are not picky about your food in the least; you could do worse.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,olVD7FN5BhHQdLaNoFUWOw,VcF4vnT_S_ZeQdlcJqAcbQ,4,Food was good and very fast.  Like incredibly fast.  Servers and staff were very efficient.  Food was a little expensive for what you got but overall a good dinner
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,dfdPD3ebqiDMPFn_1XwH2w,SGHb1veMfdCVqx8C_KLCNQ,1,Been there a few times lovely place and great food but tonight we brought friends from out of town. The guy serving is Phillip was great and really nice. But after we paid our bill and we were finishing up; nobody had said anything about what time to leave. This little man with a shaved head was incredibly rude and told us to leave. I said that our friend was just in the bathroom he turned and shouted at Phillip and Phillip told us we had to leave. What a shame this happened after a wonderful night; won't be there again ; thank you little man !!
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,JVzfx558uZ9-gaV7Ab105w,wF9HHdnQgP0fcQSG6rK5og,3,I liked it.  I got the gigantic vat sized jug of microbrewed beer so I was very happy.  The food was good too.  My kid ordered the Vladimir Putin platter of crap (french fries with gravy; cheese balls and grease) and we made love to it.  Took 5 years off my circulatory system but it was delicious...This place is right on tourist trap road so if you're lazy like us you need to eeny meeny Minee mo a place..  this one is pretty good.   ..Order the humongous jug of beer with the highest alcohol content and you'll like this place...
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,_wiyw4fWu59zjDDq7MB11Q,GIhBC1bAE8xyFMRIEnEdow,3,Nice atmosphere! but kind of disappointed with the poutine. Little salty ; not much different with the others I have tasted. Sandwich is a little dry as well. But the service is really good. Had a good time! Also ordered a cocktail; in total almost 40$ including tax and tips.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,ZM6XDLkChp6X_jYylpEjZQ,-UfO3LvYK3sXoacCcgSIbQ,2,We were not impressed with this bar. We stopped in for some beers and some food for a late lunch...The service was slow; they brought us dirty cups for water and it took a while to get served. ..The food came out cold/luke warm; it was clearly sitting around for a while. ..Nothing impressed us here; wouldn't recommend especially with so many other good spots.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,T4Vb4u839YZVuT5vHausNA,lfFLlDa2xTtGFtv_LAFqVQ,4,I will only speak for the drinks. The mojitos are very good. Their microbrews are decent too.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,bZulaajLvMzYFvb604pugQ,FDZkSCoinWaHDb9isq8ocw,3,It was OK beer and  so so pizza.  Chain restaurant in Old town Montreal; looks unique from the street; but ends there.  Seems to be the Canadian equivalent of TGI Fridays.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,tWbMe-1eZtGdoCXoia-fJA,3i4vB8mLsZrc9WMst8NZ8w,2,Ordered beer and appetizers which were good.  Appetizers came and and beer did not arrive until 10 minutes later. Now waiting 20 minutes for 1 dessert. Don't think will be back. Beer and appetizers done; 30 minutes later waitress looks over and no dessert. Definitely not coming back. Asked for extra spoon for dessert 10 minutes waitress forgot. Dropped review to 2 stars.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,9kjCbTQsNAnZZBfu0WjEPA,4,I settled into a seat at the huge island bar nearby a large screen TV hanging from the ceiling to catch a playoff basketball game and get a bite. ..Their newspaper styled menu lists a staple (thus keeping-it-simple) beer selection that includes colored dots indicating pairing suggestions. If that wasn't enough the stainless steel tanks are in clear view; which reminds you are in fact in a brew pub; and menu items fit with that moniker...Did I mention their beer is fairly priced compared to the average; and probably because they can deliver it right across the room - no truck needed...Their selection of Flammekueches (a regional European style pizza) is quite extensive and with many topping combinations will suit your mood or craving. They seem to be a specialty and the portion is more than enough for one person - in other words you could share one and a salad with a few beverages and maybe have enough room for dessert. ..Since I mentioned dessert; they have that too. The cinnamon doughnut with ice cream fits just right with an after dinner coffee (my opinion; so try your own combination and let me know)...One other standout was the above average friendliness and efficiency of the hostess; manager and bar staff. In a touristy area - this is not always the case. Surely a debatable topic; but why take away from what their staff did on a quietish night. ..In theory they could have punched out early - so with all the restaurants in competition for patrons; this gets two thumbs up.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,b6Wk6AzCTw5LV2N63MmEjQ,ms2pPIq8h6vqZkwH0MufNg,5,Great service.  After striking up a conversation about Montreal's surprisingly good craft beer scene; my server began bringing me free samples of every beer they had.  It worked; I order five pints in all!  Would definitely go back.  The chicken stroganoff was surprisingly fabulous.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,Tk_LsD3n76o56hLq8ELHsg,iNBZfC3AHdgdRfu2Luf8hg,4,Always really good; i had pizza and my mother in law got smoked meat poutine. The smoke meat was really gross. Sorry...like really gross. And i love smoked meat. my pizza was delish and ceasar salad was good as well!
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,P2oU8BQvcMvJCiwk6Nz84w,MrB-jU88lfTUs5_I1qY9xA,3,Ridiculously slow service.  It took 45 minutes to get a beer at the bar.  And that was after a regular flagged down the server and said we needed service.  (After being flagged down it was still another 15 minutes before we were helped)..We also ordered the Flamm chips as a snack.  We were advised by other diners to not order anything else; as there food was not very good. The chips confirmed that.  ..On a plus; the beer was good.  Or; maybe it just seemed good after such a long wait.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,Ht39mX4RsH4qErMvqPIy9A,YvBjrs84Yi_Q-Z7rek_hAg,3,This place was better than any USA chain; that's for sure.  Beers were not outstanding but perfectly fine.  We got reuben (recommended); linguini with seafood; and sausage/sauerkraut (also good). All great choice that go well with the beer.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,sgO-FwBPk9ILVodd9H-QMQ,kjWmGVf-D3zGtZlK26h72w,2,It's pub fare.  They make aok beers.  Screens are small.  Food is below average.  It's a Plan C when Plan A and B don't work out.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,Mj6MJvEYCfoV2H2XRbWQ_Q,5LS91lHehH6x6g2PZIeapg,5,Loved it! What a charming chain . Cool to see a multi-location establishment like this customize its offerings for individual neighborhoods - and countries; my boyfriend apparently went to a 3B years ago in Tahiti! Our waitress; Marie-Suzanne; was super attentive and very knowledgeable about the beer list - which is extensive! Laissez les bons temps rouler à Montreal
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,gT5qH2A9gm_IUq3XkRSmCA,4G_RXsOoTQGpCmZ9tOa6Iw,4,J'aime bien. Malgré le fait de que ça soit une chaîne; on le ressent pas quand on y est. La bière est bonne; et le varlet (1L de bière) est à un prix abordable à mon avis (vers 9$ et quelquechose). J'aime bien la terrasse en été; mais il faut commander à manger pour y être. Par rapport à la nourriture; les nachos peuvent sembler un peu chers mais l'assiette est très grande! (Très bons aussi). Aujourd'hui j'ai mangé ici avec mes parents et ils ont bien aimé; et on a commandé les saucisses avec la choucroutte (3 saucisses; un bon repas) et les fish and chips (2 bons morceaux de morue). Une experience satisfaisante! Les serveurs ont été aussi sympas avec nous.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,I0I83n6ehIIsiUJScvjBqw,UanK3_uD1XCmTGFGdu-N1w,3,I went here to watch the Brazil-Belgium game and the restaurant was jammed pack with fans cheering for Brazil.  The ambiance is casual.  There is seating downstair and upstairs although the game was being showed upstairs and people were packed like sardines to the point that even the servers were having a hard time getting to people...Service is what you would expect from a jammed pack bar.  The server forgot our order twice and the food took about 45 minutes before they were served to us - we had ordered nachos.  Due to the busy atmosphere we were told we had to prepay for our food and drinks...Drinks were priced reasonably and they do have an interesting 5L beer tap that you can purchase for an entire group.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,82vSXGC55BOPssPCs5ea4w,Q4dyowQ4D1HpxDd8aJf3ZA,2,Pros: easy to spot; clean; decor is pretty nice. .Cons: terribly slow service and meh beer. ..It's basically a place to dive into when you can't find anything better or are too tired to make it to a better place.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,1qa2Ui6_pt_N5O182BiExg,MPx9bljCSCxBjzpwJzvLxw,4,Their pizza it's pretty good!! (they call it differently since it's not technically a pizza; since it has no sauce) and their beer is delicious; I recommend the amber one. Great decor; nice atmosphere; even for families; and also great service.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,JPd9zh0_fJB530fp6EEz9w,l_JYZEzQd3Tvai6o-7A_9g,3,Nice little pub to stop for a quick bite in the old town in Montreal. We had a delicious grilled camembert appetizer which was perfect to share with a beer..We also shared a Lillouse flammkueche which was good; but not phenomenal..All in all; this is an ideal place if you are strolling in the area and want to grab a quick lunch; but it is also located in a very touristic area so the quality is standard..The service was good; the prices were a bit on the higher side.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,H_Apjp7AcO4sXuW0ynEGhg,tvVb5BG6R6DZAE3NSdzu-A,2,Was really excited about this place However; it took my wife and I 2 hours to have our 2 salads and order of poutine. I think it's an understaffing issues which reflects on the poor management. There are many choices on that street and I will certainly be moving on to try others. One and done for us.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,-GLuTsb2ihY4OlSDw5lFrw,f2d3hU3_9-ZO2XPVx9RHjw,4,We walked through the streets and we're looking for a nice place to eat. By accident we stopped here (around 6pm) it was easy to find a table and we had a very excellent service. I loved the beer; very good. Also the food was quite good except that my steak was not medium any more. Price is slightly on the high side it still acceptable for location; quality and service.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,bqThun6kwI4x9d5vOCZ4MQ,4,Stopped in here for some beers and food on the way back from walk in the old port.  I ordered a light Brasseur special pizza; a friend ordered the same another friend ordered a Peppy pizza and one other friend ordered theRoyal Sauerkraut.  Of course the real reason we came here was for some beer!  We ordered the special brew beer which can't remember the name but was great.  We were happy with selection and quality.  Pizza was nice and light and beer was zippy good!
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,qGSrT9FfUZAgY-Jm2Co9sQ,rtz3JPSGgdd8eZpDp4PATg,4,Just stopped in for a couple of beers at this brew pub.  It's conveniently located where all the action is in Old Montreal.  Had an IPA and a nitro Stout ($6.50 ea. CA).  Both were very good.  The Stout was very creamy with the nitro.  Service at the bar was quick and friendly.  Tastings were available first if you needed to make up your mind.  We tasted a Rhubarb and Hibiscus beer first; but it just wasn't for us.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,AIgG2rbJHMdVFv6BO64TVQ,ch3Zh7LX0EcnyfamFy56kg,3,We had hungry teens but wanted to walk down the quaint street that the restaurant was on. .The hostess had a menu in English and that was a big plus for us! .We were a bit chilled and decided to pass up their large outdoor dining area. We opted to sit inside where there was loud; live music playing. .Our server was quite jovial and had a twinkle in his eye. .We ordered some beer that they had brewed in the restaurant; it was good..We started with the pretzel and sampler appetizers. It was a good thing we got appetizers because it took awhile to get our food..My son got the French dip and was pleased..I got the poutine which was fair..My husband and daughter split the ploughmans platter which they enjoyed. .We left feeling very full and ready to explore!
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,rjhqh2eZpvl5uXZczsRtCw,HYO3LUcveIwS9s8TQOf0jw,3,Late stop by on a long Tuesday worknight for nachos and Habs vs Canucks; except uh oh; we've got a Vegas vs Tampa Bay game on. Ummm; what?? Ok maybe somebody dropped the ball and forgot to change the 5 big screens in this place to a hometown game. Nope. From the time I asked for them to switch the channel over to the local game (right when I got  seated) the Habs scored; tied the game; and the 1st period ended. Great. Thanks for switching it to the right game at the end of the first. So my nachos are nearly done at the start of the second period? Why didn't I watch the game in it's entirety in my hotel room and order Uber Eats again? Hmm; I'm calling this visit a failure (nachos are nothing to write home about). I don't hate the brand; they've come through on busy nights before at other locations so...not writing them off quite yet. Even their spot at Yonge Dundas in TO seems to have their act together during packed free-concert nights in the summer; so no excuses Old MTL - get your act together.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,KytpWg_fCxWZ3PW9ilcUhg,CayiXw5ScYwvp5vIOe3Waw,4,Walking around Old Montreal and stumbled upon this place. Seemed inviting. Food was your average bar food. Beer was exceptional. As a microbrewery they had a wide variety of different beers. Had to try them all. The double IPA was a limited run; but was amazing.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,MmkcwsKamazGqYhgMWvBNA,FnrUj3JN_FYsFrV0Oy87LA,5,Was the only place with the kitchen open late on a Saturday night ; service was really good and the food taste very well !
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,bVEQOCwSOlaCNIBHWRPfHA,g3Xznat56kg-53LYiC9SLA,4,Yes this is a tourist spot; I call it Canadian TGIF but so much better.  They are my go to quick bite place.  I mean let's not mistake this place with Au Pied de Cochon but those who writes the negative reviews think this is a haute cuisine place.  It is a pub and they have great beer selection and good pub food that goes well with it.  I think their pub food is much better than your regular pub food in the states.  The Fram..... don't know how to pronounce it but it is like flatbread pizza and their sausages and burgers are great for what it is.  The place is always packed with tourists and the staff tries to keep up with the flow but I know sometimes it can run behind especially with big parties.  I always can count on this place for good beer and good pub food.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,Jgieqjr6uTpdrnB7CY4f3g,Jz3i3b3d_AgxY_Q3uZrR2Q,3,Come here for the drinks; don't come here for the food. I enjoyed the IPA quite a bit; as well as the blonde; but even after two pints the quesadillas weren't quite edible. It's a bit harder to mess up a pretzel; so I did manage to down that with a healthy dose of mustard...Have you ever heard the Einstein quote about judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree? Similarly; you can't judge a brewery by its ability to make a good quesadilla. But when it comes down to it; I did pay good money for that quesadilla- and it was sorely lacking.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,0OupmnUHBqWc0wOJg76J1Q,qxSCT39XxlG4tYzfSgCitg,5,Great local microbrewery. Good beer selection; with a few oddballs just to keep you on your toes. Good food; laid back attitude; good beer; good bet. They win points; too for presentation with things like a mini keg you can order right at the table; a mètre de bière (that comes with a complimentary snack); and lots more. What's not to like?
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,KjApEcJZmBU2yo-MjuLTLw,CLRzOlSFtxFlnZszbXZYNQ,4,The duck confit poutine is out of this world! I tried to find it in other Old Town restaurants...very few have it there. I also enjoyed a chicken quinoa salad. Getting to sit on the street was very lucky; as the vibe of Old Town is terrific. The tables are a little close together.The service was reasonable given the right quarters and the constantly busy staff. If you prefer a bar atmosphere the indoor seating is plentiful as well. If found it delightful both ways; so just decide which experience you'd prefer.
lAXvPp580Puo-BPlbE_o1g,l3wBDIRB0B7nlVMInyohdg,OT-Abhvdez08VVkHGU-DCw,5,good beer; tasty flatbreads; fast wifi. our server was really nice and informative
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,UAS0pRzgydoM3hvYyKyvVw,NLbMCrOo1qzo-1vcuenPeA,3,Great service; venue was nice. Food was great for a quick bite because we stayed there.  Remember this is Montreal so the competition is tough for ratings.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,qgefbyCO6p2VOTNpm_Hg6w,r6_Zp7Pe1IY7_Nfk4oRSGw,4,This place was really great! We were visiting from out-of-town with some friends and had a hankering for French food; so this is where we ended up. For appetizer we had a cheese board and an order of foie gras. Both were generously portioned and delicious. My entree was a beef tartare which was dressed perfectly. Other items on the table were a steak frites and a beef bourguignon that was rich and hearty; though very salty. Another great item was the duck confit. They know how to do duck in Montreal; and this was no exception. It was cooked perfectly-- moist and tender on the inside; with the skin perfectly crisped. The decor was very classy; and the quiet jazz playing in the background only added to the ambience created by mahogany furniture and copper ceilings. Our waiter was very friendly. The restaurant was pretty empty as we visited on a weeknight; so he hung out to chat with us for a bit. He told us a lot about Montreal and recommended a great wine. If I ever return to Montreal I'd happy return to La Societe again!
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,5kNZkOrKDbBbizfz2tkgwA,XIOwU6sVC1oCe-liNC_fdQ,5,Everything is made by them. Had the smoked meat with maple syrup mustard which was exceptional. Get the fries. The banana cream pie is a must for dessert.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,A43saPMr9NLsZ25TVB8a1g,tFulkyFSPI_qiQ0kSQuKvQ,5,Great place and conveniently in the Loews Hotel which is awesome especially if you're staying here ;) we had dinner at the bar and the staff is simply perfection: friendly; accommodating and warm without being pushy or hovering ever; so we were able to enjoy talking and eating and the company. The $1 oysters (I think Tuesday and Friday's only) are fantastic and the veggie pasta was rich and creamy and filling unlike most vegetarian pastas I've come across. Definitely comfort food after a long day of travel and a cold night in. The duck confit was Devine. We are happy to have this place in the hotel for the duration of our stay.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,-s_WxkK7aTQ13U_1NlWRKw,-U2ZOlQieQgbdwAJqSDlPw,5,Excellent restaurant. Les serveurs sont aimables; serviables et avenant.  On s est trompe ds une commande d apero; le nom en europe et canada n etant pas la meme chose; on nous l a change sans qu on le demande.

lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,6iD6drB51smAYkvWR2vzmQ,Cs7d8hKqSbia0jsoNVXCjw,1,Horrible service! We were a group of about 10 people and it took over an hour to get our  brunch food. They are not at all flexible in adjusting their menu. For example; I asked for their menu item eggs in a basket but for the eggs to be well done because I'm pregnant. They said they can't do it. A friend asked for eggs in a basket but if they can replace the sausage for something else. They said they can't substitute anything; so he ended up with a tiny portion meal and after waiting so long for it. Finally I ordered a herb omelet; well done with additional mushrooms. What I got was a not well done omelet with no mushrooms. They never refilled our water glasses. They ran out of whole wheat bread and fruits. The menu is also very limited and they don't have usual brunch food like regular eggs and crepes. We all had a bad experience. Would never go back!
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,dYTN-5VD68IqYpvG8UyVrA,3Csbwxj82MzYyE1LPGCnxA,5,Delicious meal with friendly; candid service. Octopus was a specialty; flank steak frites was tasty and the strawberry shortcake was hard to share!
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,MnWvsd3aQHBZuuWDH8bxyw,JK_QM0TigAY_a2evirFNlA,4,This is a snapshot review on dessert and coffee.  The cafe americano was really well flavored.  I ordered the banana cream pie and it was absolutely fantastic.  Ive probably only had two better desserts one in france at the chantaclair and other at marea in nyc.  The restaurant is decorated spit on as an upscale brasserie but service is even better than most.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,NUiBtCTHAUK1mR_IwKhvSA,2_UnZq3R6kXTSfZcUD4Tzw,5,Love this place.很有法国风味吧台，very nice service.really nice place to go with friends. Went la societe often when I was in Toronto.i would like to say the one in Montreal is better lol
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,KpKIK29qt8YkI2KU3Wpdtg,FrwH5mI3U_8iiNTC-G3SYg,4,We're staying in the hotel and this is the restaurant in he hotel. ..The food is  unexpectedly good. Had the bagel and smoke salmon and lobster roll and shared an onion soup. ..Decor is very stylish.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,8MlBmpm6S2nxeQ5eCgl3rA,kJsHF3C83fd-K0VHSfqpAQ,3,Pretty solid food; I had the Tuna Tartare and the French Onion Soup. The French Onion soup was thick; and the cheese was good quality. Has a very nice rich taste; very heavy. The Tuna Tartare was interesting in that you crack a raw quail egg into the tuna; and mix it around. The bread could have been better; and I thought the tuna tartare was a little bit too mild and mashed; good quality but didn't have much flavor. I would only eat here again if I was too tired to venture out of the hotel..
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,crvTd67NYZS706XhFN8CLg,DMgL_E1cqWTb2__PtbD53w,5,Always a delight to eat here. The food is carefully prepared in their kitchen; everything is homemade and the combinations in the meals is well though out. Excellent service. We recommend eating outside.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,akNTT3ekmo4yj98J9Hk0aQ,h5rWaCVb9PEgUuQLCVhxeg,2,Pro;.Food was decent and had a great ambiance. ..Con;.Service was terrible; slow and they messed up the orders (ordered roast beef sandwich and was treated to half a smoked meat sandwich). Servers are in fact rude. Didn't bother with a drink as they were very expensive and contained budget liquor. ..Wouldn't recommend this place for anything more than a coffee.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,Ka3TRKrk3hBqNFDzbUQ-AQ,6F5oE2tSusTt8ombPklSyQ,5,While staying at Lowes Hotel Vogue; we went for lunch here. The restaurant is adjacent to the hotel and also is serving breakfast; dinner and has a full bar. Tre vibe is simple but very comfortable and welcoming place. The waiters were quick to take our orders; and made sure our plates always had fresh bread. Their French inspired menu is simple; but everything we tried was delicious; not over salted or too buttery. Their duck pate; the salmon over garden vegetables and the vegetarian pasta is highly recommended; it's tasted and looked beautiful.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,ygjIo5gLQ8wmsOcTDiHG2Q,kXXWSdplFhtVr_YuN75yYA,4,Ce petit bistro annexé à l'hôtel Loews a été ma découverte cette année à Montréal à table. Petit frère; à peine âgé de quelques mois; du bistro du même nom à Toronto; il présente bien et offre un excellent service. ..Le menu qui nous était offert étant conçu spécifiquement pour le festival; je devrai malheureusement; ou plutôt heureusement; y retourner pour me faire une vraie idée. Je dois avouer cependant que je suis en peine de savoir que les beignets érables-fromages-bacon; dont je rêve depuis dimanche; ne sont pas sur le menu...Comme ils offrent aussi les déjeuners; ce sera un autre arrêt à faire entre copines.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,_-PNpl5A1i_4z0YA5eM-7Q,c_e3-Bi5-j5KiHtJRadfHg,2,I asked for egg whites in my Benedict eggs and they told me it was not possible; (first time in my life that they can't do it) I had to order something else! Really?
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,BF7rMYMH6OvJOBIQhsnQvg,W89PPgDhz-ZK6iyhF_Dssw,4,A true brasserie....relexed setting great seafood...La Societe is located in the lobby of the Loews Vogue Hotel in Montreal. The restaurant features an intimate setting with a small bar and both indoor booths and tables as well as a small patio when the weather is good. They feature a selection of shell fish and a smallish menu with emphasis on appetizers and other small dishes...The Sea Bream was excellent; however I would have preferred to have the Tuna Nicoise salad with pieces of seared tuna rather than a few clumps of a canned tuna fixture...The service is quick friendly and efficient without being to pushy or having that perception arrogance that sound French brasseries carry. They are also very accommodating allowing you to sit in the larger benches when the restaurant is not busy.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,kvPBP-jLpDHrF6PYhx9qfw,NQS7Fazpe5kIGp8H7bJuaQ,4,This is a cute place at the Loews Vogue hotel.  It is decorated to look just like restaurants and bars in France.  It's a quiet and nice little place that maybe is overlooked but shouldn't be.  The service is very good and welcoming.  My daughter and I had a very enjoyable dinner here and liked the food very much.  The bar is great too for a spot to sit and have a nice cocktail; beer; or glass of wine and feel at ease.  There is a little terrace as well that is cute.  The food was good; service good.  I have no complaints at all.  I did have lunch here one day and ordered the Croque Monsieur; which comes with a nicely dressed side salad; and it was all terrific.  The sandwich was better than those I've had in France.  My daughter and I stayed at the hotel for a couple of days while waiting to move into a longer-term rental.  Since she had an internship in the city and needed to bring lunch for her first day; I spoke with the bartender about our dilemma of needing something since we didn't know the city at all yet.  They made her a nice lunch the evening before; wrapped up to fit in her lunch bag.  That is amazing service and so kind to work with us for our needs at the time.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,z4hx7ICjJokuwRlHMGRbXQ,yUZCtFsCxUyKCo8G6cchIw,4,Came for their dollar oysters on several occasions. Oysters are good; not the best towards the end when they skimp and give you like teeny oysters? Had their cocktails which were well done; one was a mimosa and the other was whiskey based. Decent service; it wasn't very busy but did not get the most attentive service for the price you pay for their food/drinks.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,bvuxor346zDAen3poNl9qA,0_pcLSWOIX7RQlNos29AFA,4,Like the bar area. A nice place to chill after a long day or work and have a glass of wine. The service was very friendly - I'd say outstanding as they were so friendly - but the sometimes we a bit slow...We had the onion soup (nothing spectacular); the meat and cheese tray (okay- I liked the selection of cheeses from Montreal).  ..Overall; I'd come here for a glass of wine and relaxation; but probably not the food.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,7J6sOvhSksLtzO9hFPEnGQ,Dbe0p-J49TvzRp6NKXshHQ,4,Got into town on a rainy Friday evening and found this spot near my hotel. The place had a nice old-school vibe to it; with of course hockey on the television (Memorial Cup; I believe)...I wanted something lighter so I opted for a French onion soup. It isn't one of those with Gruyere cheese all over the rim of the bowl; and it looked classy. The taste matched the presentation with a nice broth that was balanced. The cheese and bread was enough to satisfy...The croque madame wasn't the nicest-looking I've seen; but it tasted quite good. The egg was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of cheese to go with toasted bread and ham. The dressed greens rounded out a nice meal...Service was fine and the atmosphere was intimate. I could go here again for late eats or brunch.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,xRpEDT_5bkZFESx03CN--A,iZhQfhySF6Frnh14FrB4nQ,4,I feel weird reviewing this place because it seems like nobody comes here; and the reason nobody comes here isn't because it isn't good; or because the decor isn't nice. Neither of those things are true. It is nice; and the food is actually alright. ..I feel weird about writing this because it feels like I'm missing something. The decor is nice and the food is decent; so why does no one come here?..Am I here at the wrong hours? Did something horrible happen here before I arrived; once; or did someone in a local newspaper write a terrible review? Am I in the uncool eat place in town; and somehow; I just don't know it?..None of those things seem possible; really. Société is a pretty damn decent place. Food's good. Looks great too; like one of those French bistros you find in NYC (think Balthazar) where people gather at all hours. The only thing that's missing is the people -- at least; every time I've come here...Maybe people just haven't found out about this place yet. Who knows. Maybe it's really busy on weekday mornings. I have no clue. ..Regardless; in case you're reading this review because you want to come check it out and you're uncertain; you should in fact come. I always end up here on Sundays; once for a brunch with my girlfriend; and another time just by myself for coffee. Both times were nice. The people are friendly and the atmosphere is a cool old fashioned vibe...And hey; you definitely won't have to wait for seating. At least; not until this place gets discovered. Enjoy!
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,SBZM_4J6QWfQueuK2Nv0Ng,JqHMejDfS7p0_ViRfrU5YQ,5,Montreal is known for its diversity and is reflected in the vast variety of its restaurants. La  Société  does not disappoint . A friend and I had a lovely lunch. We were awed by the décor; the ambiance and the delicious food at a very reasonable price.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,VgSxvcdJzCaZCOnHP04VWA,_P0Brc9EV0lPM4q2G0g0KQ,5,Wonderful food and outstanding service. French onion soup was the best I have ever had full of sweet onions; flavorful broth; hearty bread and cheese. Oysters were fresh and tender. Shared the larger size beef tartare. The portion was actually rather small but came with fries so was more than enough. Casual yet trendy European feel.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,VExHvFxiVeHXgLkl4xZa9A,1gAp0Ojv98QtPeaJDscdpQ,4,I only came here for the drinks; so that's all I'll be reviewing...We wanted to get some wine in a lounge type atmosphere and since it was pouring; we stopped in our hotel's bar; La Societe. It has a very 20s style vibe inside...We sat at the bar and ordered champagne (Moet Chandon) to start. Adorned with a small strawberry; the champagne was quite tasty. Next; I chose the Rosemopolitan; which is a cosmo with rosewater. YUM! I love anything rose flavored so this was such a delight. It had a nice rose scent and didn't taste very cosmo-ey. My friend had a midori sour; but the bartender never made one before so it didn't come out as expected. But the drink was still a good one; whatever it was :)..We also enjoyed the barbeque potato chips (house made) that were gratis at the bar. A little salty for my taste; but a nice departure from nuts. ..All told we spent a pretty penny on the drinks. But the cosmo was well worth it.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,12YPK_JfOmY5bQ7jXLQiyg,cnNJNnYimisvJVIEop9eRg,4,Came to La Sociètè for a classy French dinner while visiting Montreal for a bachelorette party. It was quite good with the best part of our meal being the Seafood Plateau we ordered as our appetizer - for $95 we got a lobster salad; lobster tail; mussels; oysters; salmon tartar; and shrimp + a bottle of prosecco - it was amazing. Otherwise; amongst our group we ordered the salmon; steak; and burger and were pleased with our choices. The restaurant itself wasn't the liveliest of places; which can possibly be just because of the type of establishment it is or maybe because it's connected to a hotel.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,a41IoxVZ05aGm8i1RtdTAA,mvPv-T3vE_V0bu0Q9TSqMw,4,Lured in by a cheap prix fixe that hasn't existed for 2 years. Thanks trip adviser!!! Tuna tartar delicious and with fresh dill and the Tabasco I added...Cornish game hen  piri piri style with paprika fingerling potatoes...plating aside ; food was good and a great local restaurant. I am not book marking it as a reason to fly back to montreal.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,9VC0TgH-WEbXhyNHtWMstg,4pMG_f0Ewu8uiKKhDxvusQ,5,This was the best French restaurant that we visited in Montreal. We chose it for the seafood and oysters. The restaurant is in Loews Hotel and looks really nice with ceiling stained glass details. We ordered .- a dozen oysters on the half shell (a bit saltier than Westcoast oysters; but very fresh); .- foie gras terrine (to die for. If only they gave me a few more slices of brioche to go with it) .- lobster tagliatelle (lots of lobster).- French onion soup (good broth; a bit sweet).- 1/2 lobster roll (very fresh and tasty) .- Pork chop (very huge portion; so tender and delicious)..- asparagus with ham.The waiter was very formal but made us feel at home with our kids. Portions were bigger than what we expected.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,2uPqjeZhI_ZmQSExS1uTNg,ON6IHImj34OzknSakKJojQ,2,Classic French with a twist of looong wait times....it wasn't even worth the wait. Mediocre at best.Complete letdown.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,jRn8AOwOV9OSqla8nOK3Xw,zsd0HHP_05lvrEIWT4tR1g,3,Bit overpriced for what it is.. probably due in part associated with fancy hotel.  Food was good and service ok.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,nzF45YRIO_9WEPDBGOka4Q,idJKobAfUpAZ115WBOcORQ,3,The food here is great and they have a decent amount of gluten free options if you ask. .Sadly the service is often lacking and wait staff have been rude or not attentive. .You'd think with most of the restaurant patrons being guests of the hotel; that they would make sure their service is always dp
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,mYQmaTeWp87sGnE-rHvIOw,dJiebAb1ibvUtL944DtYBQ,3,I dragged my entire shopping entourage with me to this place because I passed by so many times and was always curious about its interiors. So we finally made it in and while I liked the space/decor; it pretty much stopped there. The service is friendly but they appear out ofbplave; slow; confused. The place was practically empty at lunch; but we hardly got any attention. Lunch that was served was just OK. I had the club sandwich and others ordered the burger. The fries that came with our meals were quite greasy and unappealing. So much promise for this  place but I fear without an inventive/creative menu and some strong management discliple; this place may not last long.
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,a9asIKrQXjd_zCcuomAUTw,KX6P8lDLB9lNU6LsgXhkXw,1,Le pire service de toute ma vie! Ma copine et moi somme rentré dans ce restaurant après une longue séance de magasinage au Urban Outfitters et comme c'est à côté et qu'ils ont du steak et des fruits de mer à des prix raisonnables je me suis dit que se serait parfait! En entrant le personnel du restaurant nous ont regardé avec un jugement de valeur qui excède le snobisme comme si ont était des itinérants ou des lépreux. On n'était pas en veston cravate mais on était pas en gougounes non plus. Une hôtesse nous désigne une table après 2 minutes d'hésitation et le restaurant était pratiquement vide. On nous donne les menu et après 20 minutes qu'on était prêt à commander personne venait nous voir pour nous demander ce qu'on voulait donc on a décider de quitter car ils aimaient mieux ne pas faire d'argent que servir des sales hipsters qui ternissent l'image de leur restaurant de snobs hautains bourré de préjugés! La bouffe avait l'air excellente mais je ne le saurai jamais car je ne mètrerai plus jamais les pieds dans un restaurant avec un tel service!
lcTa0q9Wo4wNyLCIgWFRUA,cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,aiswk-s9qOLfX_81hKDOdg,4,Came for brunch; they had lovely decor and attention to aesthetics. Each bread plate had a different design!.Food was standard breakfast fare; not a big fan of their hollandaise sauce (was dry; not really saucy). The price for our dishes were pretty reasonable. .Service was appropriately paced for a social meal; so I can see where the slow complaints were coming from. Host was cheerful though!
lS8MPnc6pHf38DWVvBEreA,OP7nO0dIaYW0O6DYX8-azQ,cdfT4pd1eqK2ugBLn1XRgA,2,I came back two weeks ago; after three years; to have coffee with a friend from Spain at about 4 PM...the food is the same; the hostile and obnoxious attitude of one of the owners has not changed; he was on the verge of having a stroke because we were not speaking in French..at about 5 PM another male employee came started his shift and he was actually quite friendly; and even tried to exchange a few words in Spanish with us. I am still reluctant to spend my money there; and quite frankly; I do not see the Parisian ambiance; not even in spite of the many Dalida posters. I have been to Paris many times and I have never received a hostile treatment for speaking English  or any other language...and at this point not that many people remember who Dalida was.
lS8MPnc6pHf38DWVvBEreA,O70Ls-Nf52BEnKb-D6vdeg,q1CtvrqC5mEc56KrUEVApw,1,Overpriced creamy cappuccinos and fresh-baked pastries don't make up for the bad attitude from the owners; whether you speak French; English or Swahili they are rude...in any possible language; maybe it's not about language but about their whole lives...Premiere Moisson also have coffee and pastries...higher quality and better service.
lS8MPnc6pHf38DWVvBEreA,QQ4vE4DQzhYMD0A-NelPyA,EJ1YIKtDB-C3w1BTzE9uDg,5,If you like good food; this the THE place. This is an artisanal bakery; they make bread; croissants; and other good stuff on site. They know how to make bread.  The two owners came from France 10 years ago the before coming to Montréal they owned a similar place in France. One of the guy is in that kind of business for my generations...For breakfeast; this is a wonderfull place. Try café au lait or cappuccino. There is a genuine expresso machine there and the owner knows how to use it...For lunch; the speciality is Soup (home made) and sandwich. You can try the salads too. Very good...I have been among the first customers (in 1998); the first day when this place opened. Each time I go in Montréal; I go there every morning (except Monday; it is closed; don't forget; the owners are French; so it is closed on Monday tradition française oblige)...By the way; if you like the French singer Dalida; you will love that place: most of the time; you'll hear Dalida and there are an impressive display of posters and other collectible. Many people have nicknamed this place Café Dalida.
lS8MPnc6pHf38DWVvBEreA,qv6zFKA9j2_YSkZ3ImUHAw,UGaz-9l1_MpH-PNms6F7Ng,1,The coffee here is shit. The owner rolls his eyes if you speak English. Gee; sorry I'm giving you money; dude. My bad...This restaurant is mainly a vehicle for the owner's weird obsession with a diva I've never even heard of until I went in this place; the French singer Dalida. ..I feel skeeved out.
lS8MPnc6pHf38DWVvBEreA,17dx_x9W_7QBT-3oiQQEQQ,7fG93WOQ8xXsW_wxtFreMg,5,Do YOU know the muffin man? ..I DO!..and he cooks up the most heavenly fluffy creations I've ever experienced.  ..creamy cappucino; crumbly muffins; and enough Dalida to satiate my brain for years to come- best way to start a morning in Montreal!
luVsJYgxGpSeAnAEs75M-w,hTZb1INhnCG8URaFywVoYQ,yQyD-LiuEFFKr7U1nq29VQ,4,Tucked away in the corner of Place Ville-Marie Dolce Gateaux features a small area for ordering hot drinks at the counter. The front is a very quaint; cute space with a clean; cafe feeling. There's a small sign with the daily specials each day (Monday-Friday) where the specials are $2; except for a large coffee on Wednesdays for $1.50. The baristas are very patient and really try to make your drink personalized and to your liking. ..The inside is also a very clean; quaint; almost minimalistic environment with cakes and cupcakes for sale and a small table with 4 chairs; perfect for enjoying a dessert with a cup of coffee after walking around. Off to the side; they also have a few boxes of chocolate for sale - maybe it was just for Mother's Day though; not entirely sure about that.
luVsJYgxGpSeAnAEs75M-w,yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,SdFS8MIj_spjKFGKK2GTCw,4,I find cupcakes are all about the icing. I have tried many types; but never one satisfied me until....Dolce et Gâteaux. It's a cute shop in place Ville Marie; with a good coffee machine. All I can say; these cupcakes are sinful but... man so delicious. The icing just melts in your mouth; and flows into my belly. The cake itself is also amazing. The perfection here is that it isn't too sweet! I have also tried their macaroons; they are addictive!!! So please enjoy them ...
lXlnZw7aWAyp1FwC1-goSA,v-la4w7HRYw62-bEKskKPg,9GSbTBvkgYj3avap5etJGQ,4,We were waiting for the show at the Basilique Notre Dame de Montreal and realized we needed a bite to eat.  We found this little cafe 1/2 block away and were impressed with our first real meal in Montreal.  We both ordered the sandwich that the waiter explained as a kind of grilled cheese with ham and tomato and we split the carrot & raisin salad.  Both were so so so good!  The salad was the most delicious salad I've ever laid on my taste buds and the sandwich... perfect!  I would go back to Montreal for this little place alone(ok; not quite; but would be a huge perk).  My daughter felt the same way and loved the food.  We split 6 macaroons for dessert and they were also very good.  ..It was a wonderful first impression of Montreal dining.

L'endroit fonctionne à la façon des grandes chaines américaines de café.  1- Prenez-vous un cabaret. 2- Faites la file au comptoir. 3- Choisissiez un sandwich; un café et un dessert en pointant ce qui vous plait par la vitrine. 4- Passez à la caisse pour une facture avoisinant une douzaine de dollars. Rien de bien nouveau...La qualité est semblable à ce que l'on offre ailleurs dans ce type de resto. Les sandwichs sont très bons. Pour ma part; j'avais choisi une viennoiserie (danoise aux framboises) pour dessert qui n'était pas fraiche du jour. Un choix de menu du jour est offert composé d'un sandwich - salade - thé ou café. L'endroit offre quelques produits fin tels que des chocolats importés. L'atmosphère est quand même plus agréable que dans un café de grande chaine.

lXlnZw7aWAyp1FwC1-goSA,Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,gIhgXjzZ5VdvJ2CeYQyUQA,2,This place was sort of fine; sort of lack lustre; sort of confused. I just wanted to sit and grab a coffee and turn my brain off for 15 minutes between meetings so I tucked into the first cafe I could find near me on Yelp. It took the waitress a while to walk over to me at the counter; she was sorta surly and the coffee reminded me of why I've been gradually turning into a careful coffee drinker (read: snob; I guess.) Tasting a bit of burning and a bit of stale; I drank a third of it and bailed. Reviews suggest the food might be yummy here; and the staff I chatted with on the way out were low key and friendly so I might find my way back here again; but then again; I have many other cups to sip; and promises to keep; and miles to go before I sleep...

He may have been new though so Ill consider that too...I would recommend this place to others as the experience we had may not be the usual...Anyway; back to the food:.We got insanely good pesto-pasta and a curry chicken pizza. The pizza had a lot of cheese and little to no sauce so I  got a side of sauce and took off some cheese...Leftovers made a great breakfast the next morning!

While looking at the menu outside the friendly waiter came out and explained  the menu to us and invited us in. Since it was a Sunday evening we hadn't had any luck finding a place that was the right fit. Well this was it. Fast service and great pasta and all for a very reasonable charge.

MikiqSyk81UYT2Xd70xCog,ulxRaEt9XoA2_qplZodvFg,ocA-F_r1hcKN0vAKg0I9rQ,4,Came here with kids based on yelp reviews. Apparently we had to make reservations; yet were seated and all worked perfectly. Place gets busy; but things flow quickly as food does not take long to get on your table. We had margarita pizza and pasta carbonara. Flavors were rich and of decent portion; service was stellar. Def worth a try if you are around.
MikiqSyk81UYT2Xd70xCog,Njt36Exm6OTOTAP61d5Uig,SKTc7nndtyC1asiviRx6vg,5,Franco Kano Reviews:.1. Food was Incredible; I was very skeptic about eating in this area and my expectations were met very easily. Good portion sizes and reasonable prices.2. Pizza's range from 14-18 dollars. They are personal sized with 4 big slices on each plate. Menu is organized from cheapest price to most expensive.3. Great salads; pizza and pasta with quick service.4. Location is great; you can sit inside or out; not too loud unless there are many people inside..5. Parking on the street is feasible .6. I've had many pizza and pasta in Miami but this place was just as good if not better .7. Very family oriented
MikiqSyk81UYT2Xd70xCog,AhyBe-uGYDJ44MpVXMflkA,ojS8nG6KjrhrNrgbX-OyWw,4,Kind of upscale; kind of casual. Came later before closing but the staff was accommodating and seated us quickly. We ordered a pizza to share which was out in 15 mins tops. Waiters spoke english and french which helped (we're dumb Americans). It seems that this place is known more so for its gelato which we didn't get to try unfortunately due to the time. The pizza was very good; crust cooked well though it could've been cooked through a little more. Toppings were fresh and had great flavor from the sauce. It was served with this interesting pickled peppers blend which once topped on a slice gave it a rich peppery flavor. .Sangria was good; made only a few fruit on top and in a decent size for the price. .Overall would return and recommend this place. Try the gelato though because I couldn't :/
MikiqSyk81UYT2Xd70xCog,Is6yWFz0wuqvRpx7zb5a1g,LpmzHNccfFtYZDWkmafIng,5,Très bon et sympa.  Ambiance chaleureuse.  Un peu dispendieux.
MikiqSyk81UYT2Xd70xCog,BifG-JPruCT-FEi1xHy_bQ,M93E9ZN2xcZLkeJlEPMh1g,5,Truly wonderful food - above and beyond standard Italian fare to the freshest; most robust and delicate ingredients and flavors. Friendly prompt service even though they were super busy to capacity and we didn't have a reservation. Speak English and French. Great experience.
MikiqSyk81UYT2Xd70xCog,S6WAo9h7PHqUDbog60pzjw,xb_DycJ7zdSCMt9tmdoHww,5,They make the pizza at a station in the dining room! Top notch pizzas!.Try the gelatos. Very nice ambience!
MikiqSyk81UYT2Xd70xCog,rmhcYlcVt4OmIDfHEF0HpQ,OmpBH-gLdhXDzKwn3G907w,4,Went here for a birthday we were a group of 22 people and the service was good. It's not a big restaurant but it's great in the summer with the terasse. The pizza is very good cooked in a wood pizza oven with nice thin and tasty crust. The gnocchi poutine is a must have soooo delicious with the cheese; sauce and braised veal. They have a pretty large selection of gelato which is great to enjoy on the terasse on a hot summer night. The only thing that was negative was that we were sitting close to the pizza oven and our section was very hot. ..I would reccommend this place and definetly go here again for a nice pizza....the prices are fair and the quality is good.
MikiqSyk81UYT2Xd70xCog,HzLNnZpKaDe-ZFkngm0UXA,d8DMtHd_JuGu0v2WlbXzlw,5,Love love love! Seriously a hidden gem! The service is on point; the food also ; however I do recommend reserving because when there's a large group ; the restaurant gets full fast.
ocopYdoCGSD-yKL3hhjoAw,WhUxO9CB5i9vzEHoQBX4TA,1xR7uUMjBX19IIVkDUSa8Q,1,Very overpriced coffee because it's imported. .Rude staff and garbage ownership aka Johnathan
ocopYdoCGSD-yKL3hhjoAw,aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,twrUhM_JKDr5I-ChAtkDAw,5,Hands down one of the best lattes I have had. Sarah was super sweet and friendly. ..Very nicely decorated with plants and has a really nice feel. Since The place is very small with a few stools to sit indoors and benches outdoor. So it is ideal for pick up in the winter. ..I am a huge latte lover; will definitely be back.
ocopYdoCGSD-yKL3hhjoAw,Cnb-zc14XLXV0A3rri_q8w,JTSynWZMG7n4U05gsYMI0A,4,The first thought I had when walking into this cafe was wow this place is as tiny as me. Then I looked up and noticed all the plants and vines hanging down from the ceiling. It was a feast for the eyes. The cafe advertises the world's worst coffee but it was pretty darn good. While there isn't much space to sit inside; there are a few benches and tables outside to sit and enjoy your coffee with a book. The service was good and the barista was very friendly and helpful. Definitely a nice little spot.
ocopYdoCGSD-yKL3hhjoAw,si7PDh4blAry09r27oZLrg,gPAW2-SIg-m0bqKINlxBrQ,5,Hands down best coffee in Montreal. Small and unassuming; right next to Concordia university. Beautiful plants and nice decor. Really lovely baristas. The coffee is always perfect; and make the best almond cortados I've ever had. The place is small but perfect for taking an espresso at the window bar. Prices are comparable with others in Montreal. After trying a lot of coffee places in Montreal; this will always be the number 1 for me. Baked goods including the raw bar are really good.
ocopYdoCGSD-yKL3hhjoAw,KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,au9X9m3xPGrQVJYXjLZVtA,4,Pigeon Espresso Bar is the newest addition to a small group of new businesses at the corner of Maisonneuve and Bishop - right next to the brand new Brit&Chips. It advertises itself as the World's Worst Coffee; something that made people quite curious. Today; my friends and I set to verify that claim. Well; it's unsurprisingly untrue. ..The place is smaller than expected; and doesn't have any seats. The interior is simple and modern; with exposed brick walls and tons of beautiful greens dangling overhead. A large; shiny espresso machine seats in the middle of the counter; next to coffee grinders and a display of delicious-looking pastries. They carry their own beans; in addition to Brooklyn's Stumptown (a very nice brand). It's not cheap (2.50-5$). We ordered a latte; an americano and a cappuccino (Pigeon brand). Service was fast and professional. The coffee was overall good; but flavours were rather weak. ..Pigeon Espresso Bar is hands-down the most handsome coffee shop in the neighbourhood right now; but its coffee still has some tough competitors...Note: Cutest logo ever.
ocopYdoCGSD-yKL3hhjoAw,0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,caZBud4TY9ISNWGNh-gsHQ,4,This little café is very close to MB building of Concordia University; making it very popular for students. There are only four stools with a slim table; so there are very few places for people who want to stay there. I highly suggest that if you want a coffee; just do take-out; because the café is really tiny. I tried their latte and it was quite good. The decor of the café is also nice with all the green plants suspended from the ceiling. It's super cute!
ocopYdoCGSD-yKL3hhjoAw,WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,LO9p2ZtJZiGqGquZoLwKYw,4,Sign in the window says worlds worst coffee... sarcasm or false modesty?  'Coz my latte was pretty darn good.  Super cute little spot near Concordia metro.  Great coffee and friendly service.  It's tiny; with seating for about 5 people.  They also have tea and hot chocolate and a small selection of baked goods.  Definitely a step up from Starbucks or Second Cup; will be my new drop in spot for a caffeine fix when in the neighbourhood.
ocopYdoCGSD-yKL3hhjoAw,DRxt228GYEkzoRFhGWdiig,adPR4Ea-yv199vktmoMktg,4,Very tasty coffee; very small space. This place is perfect for a grab and go coffee. They have pastries and their lattes are very smooth. They have about 3 bar seats; however the place is pretty small so I wouldn't suggest a meeting here. They have stumptown coffee which we enjoyed- being from Brooklyn it was cool to see. The staff is super friendly and they have quick bites as well. If you are in the area and looking for a good cup of coffee or a latte you can't beat this place. Price point is pretty similar to the rest.
ocopYdoCGSD-yKL3hhjoAw,2CrTE4dQA8biZ7SLzoFvlA,c-LuC6Tk9xajSOzv812qpw,2,It's not the worst coffee in the world; though there is a sign in Pigeon that says that. I had a cappuccino. It was not good. I don't know if the milk they used was too hot. Or the beans were not the greatest. I do know that even the first aroma that I tasted was off. It was bitter. It was burnt. Service was so-so...Krema and Difference were both excellent. Highly recommend. Myriade was OK; but was not consistent.
ocopYdoCGSD-yKL3hhjoAw,MCdgzhntTVK0OEH0ivqpEw,KcenMN6mFrvExE6__3p-Rg,3,Okay stop. Interesting little shop but the Americano I had was not very strong. It tasted rather insipid.  They were out of the premium blend so I settled. For the house brand. I was in the mood for a croissant in the morning but they don't seem to sell them.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,2ivYtkXqCQeAfXEw33tEQQ,3s8Ywy6-NFz9Wfuc859Vgw,3,Delicious food; awful service. We got waffles with chocolate and ice cream; and it was amazing. We were seated in the front window; which was good for people-watching; but apparently made us invisible to wait staff (I was 8 months pregnant; so it's hard to be invisible!). We had to flag someone down to take our order; and once our food arrived; we didn't see anyone for the rest of our meal. We had to go get the check and pay; and after my husband left the tip line blank; our crappy waitress had the nerve to come to our table and point out that he left it blank. We said we were leaving cash for tip to get her out of our faces; then took a cue from her and ghosted. Would done at a different location next time because the food was that good.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,AalklAPI6ebMzFXkWTj7fA,3JQVhFPLt5JQ5kyJngzsSw,5,Delish! Had the Guiseppe hot chocolate; savory chicken crepe; and finished with a chocolate/ricotta cheese pizza. The hot chocolate had a little kick to it and was amazing to drink real chocolate! Chicken crepe was great with the perfect ratio of spinach to chicken with a slightly slightly sweet crepe. The pizza was the highlight with nutella and ricotta cheese. On the side was strawberries and bananas. Will definitely be back.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,o8tyaVE890sZr7QSalc0pg,yHWG0qZJzNwRkBJwoQy8Dg,5,Perfect place for chocolate lovers :)! Huge menu with all kinds of dishes; sweet and salty. Generous portions too; so you'll for sure be full when you leave this place. Very cute interior design as well; I love everything about this place!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,cv1xkV09manKvs08nbLN-A,A_B0EL1hBTSPCv1JAe2Cbw,5,Chocolate Overload!! I don't mean that in a bad way either. We ordered a variety of dishes and beverages; and none of them disappointed. We had a Meat Lovers omelette; Waffles; and Crepes. All of which were amazing...In addition; their coffee and hot chocolates are practically desserts. We were tourists in Montreal; and we knew we had to stop here. I'd recommend anyone visiting to do the same!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,XTK6y-7gNrxjU_PyPds5wQ,xEYq8wfypcW8qusEaxfGTg,4,What a great place to bring your date! Their desserts are very good after a nice hearty meal from any of the many restaurants on St. Catherine...Their crepes and fondue are simply decadent!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,eaMYaERY3abw5kjLwnXHfw,ZZI_Wd9txfKtHC1NGFAYvw,4,Five star except for the loud rap music playing..If you are a nutella lover; you have to come here. Great service!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,7kfJk_NtOslC9jPk2Koz3g,mwR-mj0nd6X2P-RAKdyYHA,3,For someone with not a terribly huge sweet tooth; the options are overwhelming -- from crepes to fondue to shakes; hot chocolate and more. ..The spiced hot chocolate (CHOCOLAT CHAUD EPICE - SPECIAL CACAO 70) is supposedly a dark chocolate spiced with paprika; curry; cardamom; and espelette pepper. It was more subtle than I had expected. The flavours were really well balanced and drank rather smoothy; except it definitely is thicker than your joe schmoe powdered hot chocolate mix so it is a bit rich on the palate. $8.75...Had a bite of the classic crepe with white chocolate (CREPE AU CHOCOLAT CLASSIQUE - AU BLANC) which actually wasn't cloying sweet (contrasted really well with my drink); but it is literally just crepe drizzled with white choc. This one seemed slightly overpriced. $7.50...Finally; the classic chocolate fondue with dark chocolate (FONDUE AU CHOCOLAT CLASSIQUE - AU CHOCOLAT NOIR) didn't seem anything special. it was served lukewarm in a tall mug and while there was space under the mug for a candle; there was none. Still plenty molten; however; to dip the bits of banana; strawberry; pineapple; brownie; and waffle. The brownie was actually quite delicious on its own (actually more spiced than expected); but dipping it in more chocolate seemed excessive. Waffle squares were not good...could have been omitted. $9.50 for simple (vs. double - which i assume to be either two flavours or supersized)..Nice quiet place to hang out; with a patio out in front. Overall I can see this place being pretty exciting for chocolate/dessert lovers but for those just looking for a nibble of sweetness post-dinner; you'll definitely want to share.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,WyoiYXxSJdx26_0c_yVLZw,lP13O0ROYRz-eV8jPPuarA,4,Décoration et environnement chaleureux lors d'une journée d'hiver..La carte des brunchs est variée et le gout est au rendez vous..Les prix sont très raisonnables.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,2xFtQEr96FUtwQ48KsIvCQ,CuDyfexwTQWqsNZS8qRHDg,5,Had the most amazing dark hot chocolate here. Marshmallows were weak. But I stuck with the 5 stars because I can't wait to have this again !
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,v6qMW4cHhhEV-mfhdtNTbQ,W0GVMCK6OYdlWYOY34lKzg,4,C'est un endroit sympa pour travailler; discuter; je n'est pas goûté à tout leurs plat. Mais le chocolat goûte bon. La décoration est bien bonne; le service est en général bon; mais pas toujours.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,ZQfv1KsMzPAqQGbTJ0fWdA,n9W0VkG5fMib_-3OLcWMvA,4,My spot 4 a really genuine cacao treat. The Venezuelan as a hot chocolate  is my preferred.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,6lx4gWH02LAw923o0k8FCg,9KXp_v8Hbj25qp2uXf8GVw,1,I have been here many times for dessert and they have never disappointed me. Today I decided to try their brunch and I am sad to say that I will not be returning for brunch...The service was fast and courteous however I ordered the spinach and feta crepe with eggs. I asked for the eggs well cooked and they came runny; I sent them back and they came back runny. ..The crepe was okay but contained 95% spinach with a few speckles of feta. ..I was extremely disappointed. Montreal is full of great restaurants; if they are going to do brunch they need to step up their game. ..1 star and that's for the server.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,F58UclOWBpRtGjvvb27jvw,MNVl4aRWfY2COM9svedkLg,5,Chocolate heaven! I went twice during my recent visit to Montreal. The waffles and crepes are a must! Also their selection of coffee and hot chocolates are amazing!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,bcalCCwEIM3FVhx7amRawQ,gRJ-SyQc4jEdGMY9KIzmhg,3,Je m'attendais tellement à un ravissement de mon palais moi qui suit une dent sucrée; mais je n'ai pas été impressionnée. Tous les plats essayés n'avaient rien d'exceptionnels; la gaufre moyenne; la poêle aussi pas si fameuse. On a vu mieux ailleurs et je préfère Juliette et chocolat malgré que je ne suis pas fan. Nous avons tout de même été bien servis et les boules de chocolat à côté sont vraiment bonnes :) le goût du café décevant aussi!!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,reJ7c2yq3f8dODMslzODUQ,LFrJNuOgqRxkxI65WJeiXQ,5,This was simply awesome.  A friend recommended it and when they offered the chocolate sample when I walked in to check out the menu; done deal...Got the grilled chicken sandwich with fries.  Both were great; but the accompanying fruit with chocolate - awww hell yeah.  (Check out the pic I posted.)..Also appreciated they let me substitute eggs with bacon.  Friendly staff.  Was surprised to see this place so quiet while all the tourists flocked to the restaurants who had a patio because it was the first nice day in a week.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,StmyMWkuFFafA2gIknZwCQ,NtUuS9b3b_hcKRbkDDD1Cw,2,Quelle déception! Un décor génial; mais ça s'arrête la....J'ai commandé; au jeune serveur visiblement emmerdé d'être la; une crêpe bananes et chocolat à 64%. Rien de plus classique et standard pour ce genre d'établissement. J'ai reçu une quelconque crêpe sans saveur; pâteuse et élastique à souhait garnie d'une banane tout aussi sans saveur (c'est l'hiver; mais bon! Si tu n'arrives pas à avoir des fruits importés de qualité en cette période; change ton menu et opte pour des fruits d'ici!). Il y avait du chocolat que sur le dessus de la crêpe et en petite quantité. L'intérieur était donc sec et ennuyant à mourir... Et que dire des prix; exorbitants pour la qualité des produits! Pas du tout apprécié l'expérience! :-(
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,FFFeLM5rk29RZn6FmGlHYQ,FPBn22cfwOWWV8WlT-kS_g,5,As I was trolling Saint Catherine's  for street art; I was feeling hungry and saw this little place.Was I ever a happy camper that I did! ..I discovered they were only ten days old. Their chalkboard welcomed all its new patrons in this comfortable space...If you love chocolate be prepared to be here awhile to try their offerings. Upon seating they will give a sample of their hot chocolate they make in house. Then you can make your own custom drink with literally;  a world of chocolate to choose from...Besides the noticeable array of chocolate; I came in for the crepes they served especially the savory ones...I ordered the Europa: euro ham; Swiss cheese and parisenne sauce. Served with a spring mix salad and a light vinaigrette.  It was incredible! It completely hit the spot.  Just right amount of dressing with a surprising touch of finely diced onions. Made the salad for me.  The crepe was flavourful and filling.  I finished every single thing. Completely satisfied by the meal and finished off with a nice americano...Service was fast and friendly. Prices I felt were reasonable. If I lived in Montreal I would be a regular.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,933NaWG9W6Z-1pXMFPKOoQ,Lznvz0rJ8Ujj4kjpstRX4Q,4,Came here with friends to relax after a day of shopping. .Service was attentive; and food was yummy as usual (sometimes a bit too sweet; depending o what you get)..I would come back; especially since the location is so convenient!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,88pixU2XBbBla1-sR9ACjw,pWN6j2AZr6cPHfHc5Nfg1g,5,My God this place is amazing. As good; if not better than Juliette et Chocolat. I really love the fondue set and the molten chocolate drinks. All the 70%+ ones are great.  Definitely a must visit every time I'm in Montreal.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,yorKiu99VhiAHCGPAn-wxA,PaQsoE1yIyOgVuqBBym6zQ,5,The food was good. Loved the chocolate with my fruits. I had the crepes and my friends had the omelette. No complaints from any of us. It was a really cute place to hang out during gay pride and the cute blonde waiter was an added bonus.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,s-fKYMA-JUTSgRVuJdpywQ,eYVCVp6WR-vCZeCDVdnxzA,4,This chocolate café is great for anyone with a sweet tooth! So many options to choose from; and I got the hot chocolate with Tanzania chocolate (one of the darker choices). There's a menu for you to choose your chocolate from where they give the cacao content. The higher the percentage; the darker the chocolate. From the view in the booth; I could tell that this simple order was made very delicately by the cooks. The way they poured the chocolate into the round glass; to coating the rims with the chocolate you chose so you're able to taste your chocolate before the hot chocolate mixture hits your palette...The plate came with a mug of regular hot chocolate and the special chocolate you chose in a glass. You can taste your chocolate first before pouring some of the hot chocolate in; drink it; then pour more hot chocolate in-- all while trying to drink it without marking your nose with chocolate! Mine tasted dark enough to my liking; but I couldn't even finish my drink because it was so much and I get pretty full from chocolate easily. ..Open windows in the café; so you can peer at the outdoor seating area as well as the streets. Peaceful and chic ambiance; with great music (I was so excited to hear Carla Bruni) and the customer service provided by our waitress was great; and she was super helpful in explaining how to taste and drink our chocolate!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,vRFXZoPliF13BsfLbipjqA,foSksJ7XnTLAc9aCr_ARZA,5,This dessert for place is on another level. My husband and I came for a little sweet treat after some having some sangria. It's has a cute cafe feel and a good sized outdoor patio section. We opted to sit inside in a comfy booth. The sweets menu was totally in French and my husband and I are anglophones. I had to rely on my rusty grade 9 french but we managed to get through. I ordered a banana split waffle and he ordered the volcano. The desserts were large portions; we probably could of split one. The fresh waffles came topped with a full banana with a caramelized sugar coating. There was a scoop of vanilla ice cream along with a milk chocolatey ganache sauce and crispy dark chocolate rice crispy type balls. Beautiful presentation. It was divine and totally satisfying. My husband loved his dessert too. Large portion sizes and amazing attention to detail defines this place.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,FfDe9MuGf6pHb_RZZO3HrA,4,Location: In the Village. The closest subway is Beaudry; and street parking is available (metered). That said; in the summer; Ste. Catherine becomes pedestrian-only so you're better off using transit and walking if you visit during the summer months...The place: I ate on the terrace so didn't get a chance to see what it was like indoors. The terrace isn't huge but it does offer up a few tables. It's a great place to people-watch while you eat!..The goods: I stopped in for brunch and chose the vegetable frittata and a side of potatoes. The frittata consisted of eggs (obviously); spinach; onions; basil and feta. All of these goodies were oven-baked and served piping hot in a cast iron frying pan (perfect if you suddenly find yourself in need of a weapon).  When I saw the frittata; I really regretted ordering the side of potatoes - it was HUGE! Anyway; everything was great; fresh and hot. I should also mention that when you arrive; they bring you fresh fruit with melted chocolate. Yumm-O!..Service: Great. Our waitress was super friendly...Price point:  The frittato + potatoes totaled around $15 + taxes and tip.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,xeYgHsUoGKUa58Ayj7ISqA,qohuO-LBNT2T1xaekBbLww,1,Absolutely terrible service. The server screwed our order over and we waited for 45 minutes. Got both wrong and didn't even care to correct it!

I took the Sweet Chocolate Experience for Two with my girlfriend and it was a lot for both of us! If you're craving chocolate; go here and you'll get out of it feeling accomplished. Prices are reasonable; very kind service. No regrets because chocolate is always worth it! The hot chocolate is wow; chocolate; you can feel the chocolate run down your throat and you can feel the aroma all the way down; while making you drool.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,2Ctz8FfSioRhMy0vRi0K_g,YcC9XMDXwnGtawxkN8lypw,5,I really loved the place; it was great. Nice ambiance; great staff; delicious food. The Dark milkshake; the Outlaw chicken Waffle; and the Cacao 70 cheesecake are to try absolutely.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,hnPTPyh6wNfZe1GxOm21Gg,_PNcsCHFBSvw3DLLK4E9Eg,5,Come here for breakfast! Its not just a dessert spot; i swear you will be so pissed off if you dont. Pretty much every meal comes with some fruit and a little melted choc fondue to dip it in. I personally enjoyed my buckwheat crepe with baby spinach and feta. The spinach was extremely fresh--nothing frozen here! the crepe itself was thick and kept everything in like sandwhich; drizzle the syrup over them and let the yolk crack down onto your crepe. it will be very juicy and its a perfect pairing with the spinach & feta...The waffles are perfectly cooked on the outside too; and will be the perfect touch to a sweet tooths breakfast craving!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,ZhY5Qt76hNe4RY6u_HXfYg,-kuV_TG9iz1UQ9OlyLFn4w,2,Coffee is like any other coffee place; nothing special. I ordered triple chocolate cake and it was everything but chocolate.. probably a crep or waffle will be a better option.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,kFtpOzWygqAENd6oKrkefw,5fixQGlm92UYhkCY5eW96w,3,In a failed attempt to find a wine bar in Le Village; we ended up here for some dessert. Preferably anything chocolate. A kowinkidink? I think not! ..We walked in with high hopes. The air was filled with buttery aroma from fresh-made crepes and the decadent smell of cacao beans. Ahhh...We knew we were going to be in for a treat.....Their menu showcased a myriad of dessert options such as crepes; parfaits; chocolate something pizzzas; cakes; and cookies; as well as an impressive list of hot chocolate drinks. It was a cold night and the sound of something hot and rich was music to my ears. I decided to go with the CIOCCOLATA CALDA (Italian-style hot chocoloate). The menu states it's one of the most amazing treats in the world! Well; I couldn't say no to that; can I? It was indeed very rich and decadent. Not your typical American hot chocolate; the liquid is very thick; almost pudding-like and not milky at all. I like it! Dark chocolate is my thing and this one was leaning towards that with a pleasant hint of bitterness. For about $9 CAD; although the portion is generous; I would also like to think they only use quality cacao beans. It was a lovely treat!..I wish I could say the same for the crepe. We got the NUTELLA CREPE with bananas and strawberries. This took forever to come out but that's not exactly why I wasn't happy with this order. The crepe was huge! Filled abundantly with fresh fruit slices; I dug in and shoved the first bite in my mouth. Wow; that was underwhelming. Maybe I had too much sweetness from the hot chocolate already that my taste buds could no longer appreciate the subtleness of this crepe? Maybe... The strawberries were sour so that didn't help my cause either. The crepe; I almost couldn't taste it. I wish I ordered it a la mode but that was such an after-thought. I would've ordered a savory crepe if I didn't want anything sweet. It goes without saying; I've had better!  ..Skip the crepes when you come here and indulge yourself with a hot chocolate instead. WiFi is free; YAY! However; service was slow and they weren't even busy. Hmmm... This place is alright!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,6nCLBQ3iJ-uPs2WPUnPAcQ,o6VT_LLL9jvvt9CrIqGDyQ,5,As usual I come here once a year and  the food is always tasty. The location is great and close to the metro worth fun things to explore around it. The meal sizes are very satisfying.  My favourite part is the complimentary appy of fruit and chocolate to start.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,i_4JP5Co6WZqgoPHnIPh4g,1KFn1E44bA-d4td5dezSTw,3,I had a large dark Moka here. It ruined my day. It felt like I did two lines of bad coke. They must be adding extra caffeine. At least it felt like that to my body for a the next six hours.  The food looked great though.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,GU8fhfXKFfcZlNuHLJhViQ,p33iL3CseHRuQITVZKStkA,1,They don't accept their own gift cards. Have to argue with them to accept it. Extremely slow service. Tables only get cleared if it's needed for a new client. Overall; very poor experience and would not recommend anyone waste their time here. There are much better places around Montreal.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,5GLB61xLOP6T-pNsr7rslg,zP3-jJn3vovYEcJVTurGlA,5,Black jack - black sesame ice cream; vanilla ice cream on a cone; strawberries whipped cream; hot crispy waffle...um need I say more?..This cute trendy place was tucked on the ground floor of a very busy street filled with restaurants and bars. But if you are having a sweet craving and want to sneak into a quiet but bright oasis; check out Cacao70. The tastes of asian preferred flavors definitely made me feel at home. The service is excellent and friendly. I would definitely recommend their waffles since the contrast of cold ice cream and a hot waffle can turn even the savory minded into a sweet believer.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,Zzagn2Xg7sIcPeoP5TZ8OA,p11Bm2qtr1dcHrhVfrydmg,4,One of two favorite Chocolatier places to try out in Montreal. Multiple locations. We ended up wandering the streets of St Catherine's and ended up there on the patio. Hot day so I tried the NY chocolate Martini which didn't disappoint. Decor indoors was fun.  Definitely promoted the neighborhood feeling and staff were friendly enough. Reasonably priced with many options of different types of food and desserts - open late to enjoy.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,PbyHuvIWPDcxSBJOaqMK5g,3,I've visited Cacao 70 on Easter Sunday; I've chosen this location because it is very close to the metro which is great especially during the winter as it avoids long walks. The service was great; the waitress who served me was very professional. I have read many compliments about the decor (and maybe my expectations were high); however; i didn't see anything original about it. I ordered their American Style Hot Chocolate which was succulent as well as their salmon which was served with bread; cream cheese; salad and scrambled eggs... Hum.... I have to say that the eggs were a bit greasy and tasteless; the rest was just a simple salad with salmon and bread nothing that I wouldn't be able to do myself at home. Despite the last part of my review; I would recommend this place because they are specialized in chocolate and honestly they handled that part very well; next time I will stick to the chocolate menu and avoid eating anything that isn't related to their theme.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,49v8lBcU0k4rzDfUbnDQzg,d4UtlL45AA46eELIA-NjmA,2,I went there Sunday for brunch; and I was really disappointed by the food. I ordered the Croque Madame; which was advertised as a sandwich with ham; cheese; fried egg and béchamel sauce; but I got what seemed as a makeshift; effortless version of it... For one; the bread was not buttered or toasted; there was NO béchamel sauce; the cheese was only sliced up and not melted... Instead of the béchamel sauce; they put extra ham and cheese slices on top of the sandwich; which only made the whole thing more salty... At least I had salad; cut up fruits and chocolate dip with my plate to make the meal decent... Anyways; this place is better for desserts; for sure. Will not come back again for brunch.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,QUBKNw2IGU60Zx4m7N6tzg,B1nx1oLI2jmeyt7OQH3dww,5,Excellent ! Rien a rajouter; une superbe place de brunch pas trop cher et sympathique.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,nMtm0glrY-Jp28MPAqxAaQ,btT3EwPsnraKtn-S-fSfxw,4,Nice place if you're craving something sweet. They have a lot of options; crepes; waffles; hot chocolate; etc. Definitely recommend stopping by.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,eCwX0F88blZutAUCKTUlAA,JzJ_cJzbhEuyJ9MV2rKUrQ,1,Terrible customer service. Family of five and I came into this place. My mom and my sister were the only two who had Starbucks drinks. We walked in and were given a table with menus.  We were already sitting down looking at the menu when the person who told us to sit down asked us to leave because their policy doesn't allow drinks from other places. I checked everywhere outside and they don't have a sign ANYWHERE stating this. Would not recommend this place to no one. Most horrible customer service. Do not spend a penny at this place. Super disrespectful as we were all sitting down already with menus on hand. If you can't have good customer service; don't own a business. Will be posting my experience everywhere. Business owner myself and you're nothing without customer service.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,BczhFZoLcUG_oC9BcQHUbg,8CAnSRJJupLsQ684A7hPgQ,4,The raspberry crepe with Belgian milk chocolate is amazing! It's my go-to whenever I come here. The staff is hit and miss; sometimes it's great service and sometimes it could be better. But that crepe though; keeps me coming back...
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,o9XzWtzTuV2X9fyYevXmkw,96VxpARcXA6XhDvhg6Lbug,4,Woowy chocolaty!..I had an amazing time there...The service was sweet (no pun intended) and on the spot...I asked for cake; but not too sweet. They tailored my whipped cream and cake to be rich; but not too sweet...My friend ordered the fondue; asked for customization and got them without a fault. ..It would be so easy to cut the costs with sugar and fake cream. But they stick to quality.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,6p2nYXTNlepwncHvMxACQQ,9Yp-53xeRe0v3xBcZuLSvA,5,Ordered the after party waffle with no chocolate cereal or chocolate chunks. It was delicious!! It came with fresh strawberries and a side of white chocolate; as well. Great atmosphere. Welcoming staff. Good music. Food came out fast. It was a rainy day and it was not crowded. Lots of places to plug up laptops and chargers. I should have brought my book. I'd come back soon!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,RhftvUx56mId37aq1WX5-g,gBpqmUAluBPsJkmPfEuCaQ,4,Great dessert place; especially for Chocolate lovers! Nice place to get together with friends. Definitely worth it to order the specialty hot cacao drinks. I loved the Venezuela choice. We were 5 and shared the Bitter Chocolate Experience for two; it was yummy and more than enough! Would be back!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,1SAg_Ugf0EBSDd0GVVhi8w,Pi5RaxQeEUiP_U9ttybstQ,1,I wish i could leave less than one star. I couldn't tell if my sandwich was chicken or fish. I wasn't able to eat even half of it. So terrible. Worst meal of my life
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,bVnPZeI77zZYtMeLrTQaIQ,UtdPVI1NuWN8BSoIQncmlg,5,Just a great place for brunch! Ordered crepe; smoothies; and Montreal breakfast. All just great. Preceded by a complimentary appetizer of fruits with hot chocolate for dipping - a nice surprise.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,uDPgnEv6jZa4CSv6NX49TQ,_d7fUW4yQZjZx7jcHbFo-A,4,Decadent and rich; whether you're getting one of their desserts or breakfast meals. ..Seriously; their dessert is so fattening and it'll get you full. It can replace your lunch; if you don't have heavy lunches or if you don't eat a lot in general. ..They'll serve you some fruits with chocolate fondue no matter what you order; kind of like how restaurants serve you bread and butter at the beginning. ..I got Fondue Triple Chocolat; a tall mug of really thick chocolate (swirl of dark; milk and white); 6 small pieces of decadent brownies; and a variety of fruits. To be honest; if I knew they'd be giving us complimentary fruits and fondue; I'd have ordered something different.....What I ordered was just like; a heavier and expensive extension of the complimentary stuff they gave..Unless you LOVE fondue; order something different from what they're giving you already (basically; I don't recommend ordering fondue)...My friend got one of their breakfast meals for lunch; and he was very happy with it at the beginning; but later he got sick of eating it; because it's a looot of meat...ham; sausage; egg; bacon... nothing refreshing or light about it. Didn't have any veg or fruits. ..Great date place; good tourist experience. I wouldn't come back here again though...It's a little tooooo decadent (to be honest; after I had their complimentary stuff; I had had enough chocolate); and I'm not rich enough to keep coming back every time I want something sweet. I give four stars because I think you should try it at least once.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,6mSczadyhSs6d6V2AS_x7g,YsL9PKqaHt8ksR7AVsdm5A,4,Stopped in for dessert; and was definitely not disappointed. Loved the simple; yet comforting decor. The waitress was super friendly and was really helpful when we asked her questions regarding the different types of chocolate. They brought out a tiny sip of hot chocolate and a bite of waffle to sample before we even ordered which was nice. We ended up splitting a banana; strawberry; and 55% belgian chocolate crepe. IT WAS ENORMOUS. We contemplated ordering two but thank god we didn't. It literally covered (and overflowed off) the plate. So glad we listened to the waitress's recommendation to order the 55% chocolate over the Nutella. The chocolate was just sweet enough to complement the fruit nicely. Best of all; the crepe was only $8.50! What a deal. Definitely a great place to pop in for dessert!
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,CARjhVSK0SGDKkDiXZc07Q,rXCAcIkEy-hOjcD39qEyrQ,5,We ate here several times during our week-long stay in Montreal; and the service and food were both perfect. Excellent food for chocolate lovers and non-chocolate lovers alike.
oM8GqWtU1_ld7lLnYe3KcA,yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,pjw-mjemGpxHT0Vkd0n8pA,4,Breakfast time! My sister and I have a big day ahead... shopping day; therefore we need stuff ourselves with good breakfast...It's a rustic looking restaurant. The service was friendly; nice and super quick...I had white hot chocolate with marshmallows toppings and fruits/Nutella crepe. My drink and food were decadent. It was really delicious. My sister had a chocolate milkshake and grilled chicken/bacon waffle sandwich; which she gobbled like a maniac. She loved her dish. ..The ambiance was cold. There were few people but it was missing warmth. Even though it was warmer outside for the month of January.
oR1CWaVgPvnW9KduZZt65Q,PLXMk93bH-EjpJre-rcbWw,aALypeHDEHVM0tLZO2JQIQ,5,I just had dinner at Bronte and it was awesome.  From beginning to end it was delicious.  If you are looking for a dinner to wow you this is a restaurant to try.  The halibut was done to perfection and the dessert was a perfect ending to a great meal.  Please take a companion so you can enjoy your meal with someone special.
oR1CWaVgPvnW9KduZZt65Q,mKsK9RucmAIhnOSb3S70CA,2lNRuldG6X38y-7nAU5mug,5,One of the best meals I've ever had.  Service was impeccable.  Every detail of the night seemed to handled by a different person who was in charge of that aspect.  Appetizers were amazing and artistic.  We got a special free starter compliments of the chef.  I think that night it was some kind of sushi with a European flair.  We got the tartar.  The two of use that tried it thought it divine; and I don't even normally like it; and my friend had never even had it!  Entrees were lamb; beef steak; and salmon.  All were wonderful.  I forget what dessert was; but a dessert person came out and described them and we ordered one and shared it.  I got the cheese dish.  Again; there came out yet another person who was the cheese person who explained the plethara of choices.  It was wonderful.  We had a bottle of wine.  We stayed for 2 and a half hours.  The same people who were there when we got there were there when we left.  most of the men were wearing sport jackets and ties; so I was glad (as I had just found the restaurant on line a couple weeks earlier when I had planned the trip to Montreal) that I had insisted that we wear ties.  Cannot recommend this place enough!  Go there and experience Bronte!
oR1CWaVgPvnW9KduZZt65Q,lI8qHuapN1NPXTA95SkGOQ,2m8TW4b4sfedK7H_6XRs3A,4,This place is now called RIDI; but it's basically the same place; with cheaper prices a different menu and mostly the same staff and atmosphere.  It's more affordable and less exclusive than Bronte; but they still have maintained a pretty high level of food quality and service...The menu is Italian-inspired; with lots of pastas and Mediterranean-style dishes.  The lobster bisque was excellent and the beef was well-cooked.  The gnocchi was really nothing special.  ..There are some great Italian restaurants on Sherbrooke and in Montreal in general; so I don't know if RIDI is going to be able to compete without taking a different angle.  Everything is solid; and it's convinient if you're staying in the Le Meridien Hotel; they also have a good wine selection and good cocktails from the bar.
oR1CWaVgPvnW9KduZZt65Q,Af1bSZcn-izOR8JQJe_TrA,VW-GHGXEd3lPbf28LpJOtQ,5,I usually avoid hotel restaurants; but stayed at Le Meridien in May 2012 and tried RIDI after seeing the glowing reviews on yelp. We were not disappointed - the food was delicious; the service was friendly and fast; and the ambiance was nice (quiet on a Sunday evening). The prices weren't ridiculous for Montreal; and we got a free appetizer and liqueur shot; part of the experience as other reviewers mention. We had the grilled octopus; crab cake; filet mignon; a veal special; and panna cotta. Everything was cooked well and tasted excellent.
p1zbmLpQ3bn2hCAxNV-FOw,1JxVvMkDcFLQfupnsqWKKA,6676ON1nhNjvBx0ESGl1gw,5,Vrac et Bocaux is a recent addition the growing zero-waste grocery store movement; conveniently nestled between Beaubien and Jean Talon Metro stations...The space is very big; bright and modern and minimalism is key. Most things are either unwrapped or in bulk dispensers. Very few retail items have minimal packaging--my toothbrush; for example; but I think most people would prefer to buy a sealed toothbrush. ..There is a bit of everything: loose tease and spices; grains and pastas; nuts; dried goods; fresh produce; baked goods; cleaning liquids like dish soap; as well as reusable cloth bags and jars...Staff was very friendly and there were a handful of customers shopping when I visited. Since most of the items are organic; it's not really a  budget grocery store; but for what it's worth; fair prices...With such a large space they could easily host workshops. Not sure if that's in the cards but I would suggest it...If you set up a client profile you can opt to not print your receipts and they will be kept on the computer.
p1zbmLpQ3bn2hCAxNV-FOw,aU6Mq536aI1r_BunJE-V2w,ojv4_23IU2CY1iNU-fDpMQ,5,Très cool comme concept. On apporte nos propres contenants et les remplit. Il y a assez de produits variés pour ne presque plus aller à l'épicerie (farine; riz; pâtes; légumineuses; légumes; épices; produits ménagers; friandises; lait; œufs; pain; café)..Ils ont une très cool machine pour faire du beurre d'arachide ou beurre d'amande. Ainsi qu'un fut à boissons avec kombucha. ..La plupart des produits sont bio; alors un peu plus chers. ..Le seul hic c'est que ça l'a été compliqué remplir les contenants a épices.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,PJupsYutu5scuwE0hUhJnQ,eSu5edYyMFrnCy6_VlbgYA,3,All the cupcakes looked beautiful at Les Glaceurs.   And the ice cream whetted my appetite.  These were all wonderful; but then I saw the macarons; and I knew I had to have them.  I bought a bag of four for five dollars and ate them in one sitting.  The four kinds in the bag were (I think) pistachio; vanilla; chocolate; and mocha.  Of course they were good; but they were not as fresh as the macarons at Point G.  ..Also; the service here was not great.  I was the last person in line and after the person in front of me was rung up; the cashier ignored me and went to the back to clean.  I had to practically bang the counter to get him to come back out.  ..This is kind of in a tourist area and although a very cute place with several gorgeous looking cupcakes; I might find another place for desserts in the area.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,Myy-tV1aKksxkQ2R7QUkAQ,e4xuHAyX018SCsr9cer1kg,4,Les glaceurs have a quick a variety of cupcakes; ice creams; sorbets; and macarons to satisfy the pickiest of all dessert fanatics. I love their cupcake and ice cream combo! I shared a red velvet cupcake and a small cup of grapefuit sorbet with my boyfriend. I have had better red velvet cupcakes in Chicago; I found their rather sweet but the sorbet is excellent.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,mF6AsomFJOYXoCbEdMZE0A,vmA9Cw4LtJF88CH_vW6QRw,5,I saw this store when I was visiting the Montreal Bascilia church. This store is on the arrey next to the church and is easy to find. To be honest I am not a big fan of cupcake but they have pretty and seasonal cupcakes on the counter. The time I visit was Easter weekend and they have Easter Bunnie cupcake which is very cute but it was a pity I traveled by myself and it would be very awesome to buy one for your gf! I will definitely come back again.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,55e8VY-J0K026BofU8IozQ,YSg_fcR53eBXzpLBxKklcw,4,super cute space with really nice presentation of their cupcakes.  the red velvet was one of the best cupcakes i've ever had.  the strawberry was good; but the frosting was a bit too sweet and it overpowered the cake.  would've loved to try the maple; but they didn't have any out when we went in to purchase (we had seen them when we were just browsing the day before).
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,mhA-scJJBbad8LYi1SHaiA,IYNB03lm8_IplCX1ECbipQ,3,Their website is gorgeous and the fact that it is both in French and English was a real treat for someone placing an order from California. Service over the phone was great: the lady was super friendly and highly knowledgable. She took the order; helped me pick out a card and wrote the text i dictated. I asked to deliver cupcakes to a friend at the Jewish hospital and paid everything incl delivery with my AMEX. When i called the next day; i found out the delivery could not be made. Apparently the delivery guy could not find the room and returned the cupcakes to the store. He did not think about asking at the reception/front desk where my friend was staying (i provided the full name). I was very upset! I didn't it was thinking out of the box! And he made it to the right floor; but turned the other way and got to a different unit. I was bummed. I paid for delivery again and the cupcakes were delivered that afternoon. My friend said the cupcakes were yummy; but the whole experience left a bitter taste in my mouth...
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,YsnVq-tnmUoCjO5d47jFFw,ZrNqZvodvmhoTKX5VNnvBg,4,I was wandering around old montreal and happend to stumble upon les glaceurs; a cute little shop that sells cupcakes; french macaroons; sorbets; and ice cream!  ..Its located off a little street right next to  a huge church.  The cute window display and the woman that I just saw walking down the way with sorbet peaked my interest.  I walked in to find a variety of goodies awaiting my consumption!..I decided to get vanilla macaroons; chocolate macaroons (that's all they had left) as well as pear sorbet and litchi sorbet!  They also have maple syrup ice cream which was just to die for; but I could not consume it all by my lonesome...The vanilla macaroon was first. I took one bit and the whole macaroon opened with a bright white cream of goodness inside!  It was amazing!  Soft; creamy; and crunchy all at the same time!   Then; there was the chocolate macaroon.  At first bite; the luscious fudge center poked its head out and greeted me with intense chocolatey goodness!  This was unlike the vanilla macaroon; which I was able to eat in three quick bites.  This macaroon was meant to be enjoyed in many small bites; slowly; sensuously; and seductively.  ..Damn; it was good...And then; the gorgeous scoops of litchi and pear sorbet piled high upon a simple cone.  The sorbets are made by a quebec company; and they focus on using the freshest ingredients.  ..The litchi flavor is ridiculously fresh.  It does not seem to have any artificial flavors; only the sweetness from the juice of the fruit.  Perhaps the fruit is pureed and then formed into this gorgeous sorbet?  ..The pear sorbet is sweeter with rich flavor; texture smoother than the litchi; and mirroring an actual pear.  It is a wonder to me that I have not found such amazing sorbet in the states.  The canadiens know how to do it right; that's for sure. :)
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,1oj3iR03QOq1Tcqg5OO_Vg,4FSqwIoJgLsaMpPhLsNu_Q,4,This is one of my favourite ice cream shops in North America; but it's not their frozen delights that make me obsessed. They happen to sell the most delightful cupcakes. The traditional flavours are all brilliantly executed but the one that has my heart is their Vanille-Citron; a light and sweet cupcake with a perfect lemony finish. Delish!
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,cqgjW23FJyu5kFlRDN1CpQ,GavwW-dNrQGS0CjuSEj8ew,5,My friend and I walked on over for some dessert after eating lunch at Olive et Gourmando. Les Glaceurs serves the most heavenly; delightful; enjoyable; scrumptious; delectable; soft; fluffy; yummy; and visually appetizing cupcakes I have come across in Montreal! An added bonus: They sell Bilboquet ice cream AND Macarons! What else could a woman need? Seriously...For the longest time; Itsi Bitsi has been my all-time favourite for cupcakes; but now... they have some serious competition! ..I tried Les Glaceurs' Red Velvet (instant winner); and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough - both were good; but the Red Velvet stole my heart.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,snbSGbWh9L4ZWAocIn2TvA,CdYL3EypCu-hKHEpKGayPQ,4,Bought four cupcakes to share with my husband for his birthday. The cupcakes are small and very pretty... quite gourmet. My initial thought was that they'd be dry and bland (coming from LA; I'm used to giant cupcakes topped with an insane amount of frosting) but to my surprise they were moist and rich. Much sweeter than I expected; in fact. A couple of them were cream filled; which I also didn't expect but was happy to find. Very tasty. The shop is located in the Old Port so traffic and parking can be a pain but if you're in the area and want a sweet treat; definitely walk over and grab a cupcake and ice cream scoop. You shouldn't be disappointed.

And when she has a crazy schedule and it's a total hassle thank heaven for a kind cupcakery . . . Delivery made; a whole apartment-full of 20 year olds happy . . . Priceless.

Just a stone's throw from Notre Dame Basilica so there's no excuse to not go because when in Montreal; you have to see the Celine Dion Church. This is my second time here and it's so good and the staff is so nice. They also have little mini cupcakes in case you're like me and find yourself just eating through Montreal like there's no tomorrow.

qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,bYcOiNUIKLOn2AralAFs0Q,ZYoN6JL6iooFGZfPYt2spA,3,We tried two gluten free cupcakes at Les Glaceurs. The chocolate one was dry and heavy and we did not like it but the red velvet was just made and tasted better. It was moist but still quite heavy and very sweet. They were satisfying but for this price we've had much better ones.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,QC4iwAt4o1SnLua_NEo3uA,lEQjFOTE9COSDl9iCHVXQA,2,I've been to Les Glaceurs twice; once at the Saint-Sulpice location; and most recently the new location on University & Ste Catherine. ..The red velvet I had from the Saint Sulpice location was HUGE. A bit on the sweet side though and topped with an enormous amount of frosting; it satisfied my sweet tooth (alas; the grease stains on my napkins did not). The egg nog/gingerbread cupcake from the University location was a bit on the dry side and very small. The frosting tasted overwhelmingly of alcohol (the whole egg nog thing). ..The service at the University location was terrible. The girl heard me tell my boyfriend that I had tried a red velvet so she assumed I wanted one; grabbed it; dropped it; then blamed me (when I told her I didn't want a red velvet; she replied with but you said it out loud...no idea where her logic comes from)...a tip: if you have foursquare; upon your first check-in you get a FREE cupcake! Apparently no purchase is necessary

Mais le jeu en vallait la chandelle !.Après 10 minutes d'attente pour choisir mes cupcakes et 20 autres pour les payer; je resors enfin avec la boite promise... Heureusement; l'odeur des petits gâteaux sortant du four est là pour réconforter les clients impatients... A l'intérieur; les parfums préférés de mon chéri: chocolat et red velvet. La boite n'a été ouverte qu'à l'heure du goûter; les cupcakes ont passé une après-midi au frigo; pourtant quel délice ! Pas trop sucrés; pas trop bourratifs; pas trop de glaçage. Super bien décorés et simplement exquis. .Autre surprise; et je ne partais pas très convaincue; leur latte! Bonne qualité de café et plein de mousse Miam Miam !!!..Je recommande plutôt Les Glaceurs pour du Take-away. La déco et l'ambiance des lieux ne sont pas follichons...En revanche; vous êtes sur(e) de faire plaisir aux enfants; votre cheum ou blonde et surtout à vous ;)
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,HNqeYFG_-g9SWt8wfd66Kw,ctNfk9UX75CbuBrgQLZRZg,4,After getting caught in a torrential (not even kidding) downpour without my umbrella; I was in serious need of some cupcake therapy of the Red Velvet kind.  Lucky me that Les Glaceurs was right on my way back to the hotel.  ..I was soaked head to toe so ice cream didn't appeal to me; but the cupcakes caught my eye.  Oh; did they look good!!  I got one of the red velvets and a coffee to warm up and settled myself in to enjoy.  And enjoy I did.  The cupcake was delish and the coffee hit the spot.  The only thing about the cupcake that I wasn't crazy about was the icing.  It was too sugary sweet for me.  But the cupcake was perfectly moist and crumbly...The shop is a bit small and looks like it could get crowded easily (it was a tight squeeze when I was there on a Friday afternoon).  There are some comfy chairs up by the window that would be perfect for a longer stay but this really is more of a grab and go type of place.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,wsT8ixKpghlsnTRsPA6RXg,aHH-2EBezr8A2FwJNxxZcA,3,Les Glaceurs was the first time I ever attempted to even go to a cupcake joint. I was never really into the idea but a couple friends convinced me to go and I have to say I was not disappointed in the least bit...Les Glaceurs is simple. You get cupcakes and ice cream and that's what they do and to be fair they do it very well. There is a good deal where you can get a cup of ice cream and a cupcake for I believe it was around six dollars so you get a good amount of food for the price. ..The ice cream was excellent and served in a good sized container. You got just enough to satisfy your craving and the flavor of the ice cream is excellent. It's a perfect way to complement the cupcake...But of course there is a fault here. The cupcakes aren't even warm. The experience could have been so much better if the cupcakes were warmed up before you ate them. The contrast of hot and cold is commonly seen in dessert and it could have made this experience easily a four star one. The cupcake however was good for what it was. I chose the Red Velvet Cupcake and the flavor was that of a true Red Velvet cake. It was very moist and it had excellent flavor. The icing was also really good albeit almost too abundant. ..Overall this place is quite good. It's definitely a nice place to stop into and I have to say I enjoyed the experience and would go back. With some small improvements it could be an excellent place to go but for now I'm gonna put it at around three stars.

qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,_6mYuHzFIEwH8gIJdEeCoA,3,Definitely a little bit of a tourist trap but good for a quick; expensive cone...They offer the cutest mini cone; a size I've never seen in the States. For 3.69$; you can get a regular; single cone; as well...I got the pistachio; which had a few chunks but I found a bit too artificial tasting; like it was made with pistachio extract. It was still very refreshing. My husband got the caramel with chocolate chunks; which was decadent...A handful of seats including comfy chairs in the front. Also has a public bathroom.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,oQwFLohuwcJYMd0WhCph-Q,ovlDRS4dNL-arWuqiVrxoA,4,YUM- litchi sorbet is one of the most delicious sorbets I've ever tasted- sweet but not artificially fruity.  I want to try all their sorbet flavors- they had about 12 of them; as well as a whole ice cream case of ice cream flavors.  The place is cutely descorated in pink and circular mirrors; chalkboards/signs; and cupcake paintings.  On a little side street next to Notre Dame; this place must get hit with alot of tourists.   I think I'm going to come back here tomorrow for a cupcake- those looked good too.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,gQ8mvIM4PCFepn1wn5YC1A,56r1TBoIjMhNbiVeUG7ZLw,5,Nice staff. Scrumptious cup cakes! Getting a cup cake and eating it in front of Notre Dame: one step closer to cloud nine!
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,j58hmvZSFl77g5m1TXIj5w,phA11TNwdnNpbbKDiMvQ7Q,5,Un seul mot : décadent. ..Cet endroit m'a fait changé d'avis au sujet de ces petites pâtisseries qu'on appelle cupcake. Je vous recommande particulièrement ceux à la crème brûlée (disponible l'hiver seulement); ou encore gâteau au fromage et bleuet (saveur du mois de mars). Un délice véritable. Il y a aussi les red velvet qui sont tout simplement savoureux...N'écoutez pas les critique de certains yelpeurs américains qui prétendent que les cupcakes ici sont trop sucré et que le service est lent. Ils ont tord. Les saveurs sont parfaitement balancée et le service est rapide.   ..Je recommande.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,KGPPQsnPBJpUxCXBVuSpEw,hFC6zsaB-7Mbs7E9qNiXiw,3,Service rapide malgré le monde le décor est vraiment sympa malheureusement mon sorbet orange sanguine était cristallisé et la crème glacée pistache ordinaire. Il faut dire qu'il y a du débit mais c'est ordinaire par contre les cupcake sont cute
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,SBATSqUJYhF4nwNJS2ikrg,_OWibXtWBSsGBUfzLCp1oQ,5,hands down best cupcakes i've ever had. my boyfriend and i have gone on vacation to montreal twice in the past two years. both times we have stayed at le saint sulpice; which is a boutique hotel right across the street from les glaceurs. ..the red velvet and the vanilla cupcakes are delicious!! the frosting is amazing and the cake is soft and delicate. i cant wait to go back! i haven't found a cupcake yet that beats this!
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,R4LMOs3T3IS-ceTQ-yOiRg,vcI-DD4xmPJOovS9snetqA,4,I am not a fan of cupcakes. I prefer to get my calories from other types of deserts; like chocolate deserts :)..I was walking at the old port and finally decided to try the glaceurs. The place was beyond my expectations. And I can say that it is the best place for cupcakes ..I went there during an afternoon and  asked the sales women what was their top 2 cupcakes. She answered direclty ; our best is the red velvet and the vanilla cupcakes. .I tryed the red velvet and it was really amazing !.it was tender; fluffy from the inside and chocolaty. The topping was sweet to perfection. It was the exact right amount of every ingredient..This is how you get a client to by other cupcakes. ..I do recommand this special red velvet cupcake.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,XeHoaj7ux-OJwsTVZ3AMPw,sZW3whuJj6-M6LoHUmFqSA,5,Seriously one of the eat cupcakes I've ever had! (I ordered the salted caramel.) Very fresh; and fluffy. Perfect t crumb. Also; good service and very clean interior.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,aLaZG8OT-oB_BtdVKuvVeA,5,Picked up half a dozen cupcakes for the Easter weekend. I got to enjoy half of the Caramel Sale and the Red Velvet. I'll be honest; the Caramel Sale was out of this world good but the red velvet was pretty good too! ..I think war can be stopped if we just delivered thousands of these cupcakes to them...Finally a cupcake place with actually really good cupcakes! Price-tag is OK; shame there's none in Laval....
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,Vje9AcZL9kPyFqgDvvISOQ,iHDcMFAAz7u8whoNLEeFXw,3,Delicious little cupcake and ice cream spot.  We stopped in for an espresso and a few birthday cupcakes.  There were out of many of the options for the day; but the cupcakes we got; were delicious.  One had a gooey caramel center that oozed when you bit into it; YUM!  The place is simple; right near Notre Dame Basillica; it's geared for tourists; but delicious.  With all the amazing pastries in town; I'm not sure if I would seek this place out; but if I were walking past; I would probably dip in for a drink and a sweet treat.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,oQwFLohuwcJYMd0WhCph-Q,7_UCrB0a2khEIFi480Gx-g,4,Came back for the cupcakes- those are good too!  I recommend the vanilla w/ salty caramel; as well as the choco-orange.  Most of my fellow samplers liked the red velvet as well.  We bought an assortment of 12 for a birthday dinner- all were delicious!
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,oXAdMWknx3ps2xFMEO8MnA,mORcvvHN7ly4tDlX2bSY9w,5,Toujours satisfaite à chaque commande. Produits frais. Souci du détail. Ponctuel. Magnifique créations personnalisées avec photo!
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,iYwvHpgiLqBX2dFJhx7zBQ,pIKWsx3KHaT2H7R3L84JOQ,3,It's your ordinary cute trendy cupcake shop. Do you have something better to eat after you've just toured the Notre-Dame Basilica? Probably not...Service was great. However cupcakes are a little small in my opinion.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,2FywH1DoTKMwXMRz1DPwPw,Ef7ExrgU70buAjVQOMtBKg,5,1. Ice cream: great combinations and flavors! Ordered the pistachio ice cream and the mango/coconut sorbet. Pistachio was a bit tangy and sour (in the yogurt kind of way); which was interesting and unexpected. The mango coconut sorbet was the most novel and unique combination I've had - fantastic blend of the two; and a tropical delight...2. Atmosphere: some seating; fast food style. Touristy area; so lots of tourists leaving their used cups and napkins on tables. ..3. Service: order at the counter. The two attendants were quite busy when we were there; but managed as best as they could.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,UVs_7nPjqK_W_ap96IClpA,Xqu1MuHeN6OzuNG87LMBOg,3,Good for a quick treat but kind of overrated. The shop was super crowded when we went in and it was difficult to see the different flavors in the case. They did have a menu on a chalkboard but I like to see the ice cream before I decide :) ..I ordered a mini passion fruit sorbet and it was super tiny but a good size for a small treat. The lady at the register quickly rung me up but she was kind of surly. Probably because there was a huge line of people. I took the cone to go and the flavor was very nice: sweet and tangy at the same time. I wasn't extremely impressed though; so maybe the ice creams are better than the sorbets?
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,h_-ZhN_mFN8QO-L46bewkA,vTNI-4-KWYg7EbtM31tr_A,2,I so desperately want to give this place a better rating.  The cute cobblestone street; next to the cathedral. The little French babes behind the counter that can make a man's knees wobble with their cute accents and pretty smiles.  But there's no masking the harsh fact that this ice cream and sorbet is boring.  No flavor.  Look elsewhere if you can. And send me a note if you're successful anywhere in MTL. I'm coming up empty.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,h_1UE0CxAf1Blt2Oigkxig,mahs0NE99435cq7h9BQg2g,3,Les Glaceurs was a nice visual experience from the mundane cupcake aesthetic. The taste wasn't too much different from crumbs in my opinion. I wasn't blown away by their flavors although they were creative. Customer service was attentive and talkative during my visit. I would recommend this establishment as one of the places to get a cupcake in old Montreal.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,HgCv2lm-GuACRanD7bSqyA,Y-Spw1C44UXi7nnn2pGveg,4,Trying to get away from the throngs of tourists that were herding themselves down Rue Saint Sulpice to port area of Old Montreal; I also started craving for some ice-cream and gelato. .The sign hanging outside the door was all it took to convince me to seek shelter...Luckily not too many people were inside; and I was able to take a good look at the displays of cupcakes and ice-cream flavors. I decided on a lemon cheesecake cupcake and a mini sized very chocolaty looking with nuts ice-cream (a Moka-Foulli flavor?). I'll just say that the ice-cream did the trick to cool me down until I decided to head on down to the port area...It's a haven to stop in if you want to escape the crowd and enjoy some cupcakes and frozen treats for a short time when you're in the area.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,6tbXpUIU6upoeqWNDo9k_A,EH8neCaXY90CJpEYUmcsNg,4,During my touristy stroll through the history Old Montréal area; I needed a fix for my sweet tooth!  Lucky me; I see a black sign with neo green words  Les Glaceurs  with drawings of cupcakes and ice cream cones.  As I walk in; the display of beautifully designed colorful cupcakes boast a delicious time yet to come.  The price seems a bit steep with $2.95 per cupcake; $16 for six and $30 per dozen.  I got the red velvet cupcake on my first visit and the rum raisin ice cream cone on second time back.  The cupcake's frosting wasn't too sweet and in my opinion; if they scaled back on the frosting and made it slightly more moist; it would be perfect.  The  rum raisin flavor has always been my all time favorite ice cream flavor since I first tried the Häagen-Dazs variety many years back.  The two other variations of this flavor at Lappert's in HI and at this location are equally as satisfying or better.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,ENSYT8atZM8gus_xXDzzJQ,uiqdHL-qh951MsAIuNTKsg,3,I have to say that I don't really get the cupcake trend; and I'm glad it seems to be winding down. What's so great about a cake in miniature? I'd much rather have a slice of a large cake than a small; dried-out one with a whole bunch of stuff piled on top...Okay; enough grousing. The decor here is pretty adorable and the cupcakes were actually decent; though there was way too much icing and the whole thing was too sweet for me. We got the maple flavored one; which came with maple buttercream; a syrup drizzle and some candied nuts. It was fine. I would have rather ordered ice cream; but the weather (cold and rainy) didn't seem suited for a frozen dessert...Bonus star (it really deserves two): unlike a number of places in Old Montreal; no one batted an eye when we paid a $4 check with a credit card.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,5fs8ZE8I4Epam3f-pgNkiA,5yRtqxEyI7n2vZyAYF7goQ,1,Worst cake ever; unfortunately. It looked beautiful but it was hard; compact and no flavor at all! I had the chocolat praliné made for a birthday. Nobody could pretend to like it! The staff was really helpful and very nice. Again; the cake was beautiful ! I wish I cold write a better review...
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,IGHmwV_vPsCJQUCdFar3pw,UkSj53EgFYDCFy3LQCEDPg,3,I was craving a sweet; moist cupcake and the concierge told me this was the place to go.  Lovely setting. Clean; spare room.  Les Glaceurs had a fantastic selection of ice cream that you can purchase in three sizes and a display of yummy looking cupcakes in a variety of flavors.  Perfect!  I could have the mini ice cream and my cupcake and not feel like I had completely overindulged...The ice cream was wonderful.  The cupcake was a disappointment.  Dry; no flavor punch and frosting that was nondescript.  I threw it away after three bites as it even tasted a bit stale.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,DRDjrfODfL0a1E_NB6YKAw,ytxj3deYGsYp_gIlgEY2_w,5,Super beau; super sucré mais super bon! .À déguster à n'importe quelle heure de la journée..N'hésitez pas à passer commande pour profiter des délicieux cupcakes aux goûts d'alcools bien connu!.Différents choix de glaces également; le tout pouvant être accompagné par un thé ou café...
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,gqnhxCtGgnOhVeqAzT5ywQ,p7LoNyTafjmv6ePj54HoWw,4,I would have given thus place a 5 star but the truth of the matter is that Mollys in Chicago is the best cupcake shop. I liked that they have an ice cream or sorbert and cupcake combo. This makes for a perfect dessert date where you can share a dish. If you are in the Old Montreal area; then you should stop by and get a treat.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,FsoA_HciMK9-23F_Idx_jA,2GOLm8_3_c8ftRGnnftldA,5,Delicious ice cream. Prices were reasonable. It is hard for me to have ice cream that I do not like. You can't go wrong with ice cream anywhere..The flavors were unique which is a plus as well. I like experimenting with ice cream..On a hot day in Montreal; I recommend coming here. There is free Wi-Fi as well. They sell cupcakes too.. but I did not indulge in cupcakes..only ice cream :)
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,XHP6Kvw0UxekKpRPJjF77Q,VtUCak__oKaQdlSfduQ9HA,5,The most amazing ice-cream I've ever had. Went with my partner we went back for more as soon as we were done our first two scoops. I had the mango and strawberry gelato scoops.
qUQra6oN0vS595c8lZFVaw,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6GOF2Cry0PJ2dTl3OSi_tg,5,Moving from 'French' to more of the North American vibe (but still with Canadian touches) the first of our next three sweet shops to visit would be Les Glaceurs; and although some will claim the trend is played out I still love the concept of individual sized desserts that allow me to sample a variety of flavors and therefore while it may seem outside my 'gourmet' tastes that means I still love a well made cupcake...Apparently a small chain centered in Montreal; Les Glaceurs had originally been left off my agenda as we had planned to get ice cream at Bilboquet; but when the shop was inexplicably closed and we found ourselves faced with cupcakes AND ice cream as an alternative we figured 'why not' - a surprisingly good decision that eventually led to us ordering three great cake including the standardizing Red Velvet; Salted Caramel; and the monthly special Tire d'Erable...Priced at $3.00-3.50 each and perhaps only 3-4 bites per cupcake expectations were high for the quality of these tiny treats and beginning first with the Red Velvet we were adequately impressed (aside from the red hot on top.)  As the only un-filled option of the three the cake to cream ratio was spot on with the former dense and cocoa laden while the later was light and smooth with a bit of added sugar on the outside for texture.  Moving next to the filled options; Salted caramel was an equally well constructed cake with a light vanilla batter topped with rich buttercream frosting and a drizzle of caramel; but what set it apart was what was inside - a liquid caramel center rife with sea salt plus a light dusting of fleur de sel on top...Moving last to the Tire d'Erable; an obvious choice given the season; our location; and my predilection to anything Maple - it was probably the best cupcake I've had in 2012.  Beginning first with the same dense vanilla base as the Salted Caramel but this time swirled with maple in the batter and then replacing the buttercream ice cream with one of whipped maple butter before adding caramelized maple syrup and maple candied walnuts this was a flat out embarrassment of sweetness that pined for a glass of milk or coffee while also wishing I'd have ordered another - or picked up a few for breakfast the next day.

While delicious; however; the prix fixe format felt like a ripoff: the included starter and dessert were both unnecessary and not particularly tasty; seemed like a way to add value to what was in essence just overpriced brunch.

The menu is not extensive if you're looking for a big variety. Had the tartine aux pleurots with poached eggs; greens and lardons: perfection!  The poutine inversée was a creative twist on a classic and a bitesize burst of flavour! Service was good although not great for an early brunch.
RAEY1h0WidFtpTm8eGhVHA,87xXrdE_4csYT-YTMnMVWA,d4zpjLIS3E5ZM6Tn8Yd5xQ,4,5 stars for the charming place.5 stars for the service.4 star for food..We had brunch; the eggs Benedict was really good..Salad was decent..Their version of poutine was amazing!.Pudding chomeur was just ok; way too sweet; there's more sugar in here than dessert!  ..Service was great; very friendly staff; and very friendly owner! Both extremely helpful and gave us great ideas for places to check out around town!

Made to share. Simple; French-inspired food. Menu isn't super different from whats in the hood. Prices are super fair. ..I had the beet; apple & mint salad plus the shrimp ragu on pancakes with eggs. Both were tasty but a bit bland. Needs seasoning. Pass the salt!.Definitely a must try...Make a reservation; they say.

RAEY1h0WidFtpTm8eGhVHA,3NvmvvKNUcigSkT5OlLM7A,YLQvmfTZooo96ZaTMKnEMA,4,Special Easter menu today. Quite a pleasant discovery. The medley of flavours in the dishes we tried worked really well together. Presentation was beautiful. The restaurant is quite small; so noise level was loud when everyone was talking.

J'ai également goûté l'omelette de la personne qui m'accompagnait. Mon coup de coeur; hyper légère; cuite à point; très moelleuse; farcie d'une crème aux herbes vertes variées ..J'ai pris le plat de betteraves; feta; oeuf poché et pois chiches. Les plats se situent entre 4 $ et 14 $.

The poutine inversée is a must to start off right; then let the friendly and knowledgeable staff guide you for the food and the wine. (Also; if you're a blood pudding enthusiast; or even a blood pudding virgin; GO FOR IT! Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside; with the perfect seasoning!) This little house really will make you feel right at home!
RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,apOiViwi2XCwEERFM40Zww,5.0,I first tried Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.  The Brooklyn location was pretty crowded.  We waited in line for a while to enjoy communal seating and grumpy Eastern European servers.  The pizza was good; but exhausting to get to. The local Grimaldi's has the great food with none of annoyances...If you insist on thick crust/Chicago style pizza or don't really care what people throw on your pizza then; seriously; what are you doing?  Do some frickin research.  But if you like thin crust pizza; with high quality ingredients; this is the place for you.  ..I suggest asking for extra cheese.  The mozzarella has always been the bomb and worth every penny.  All the ingredients are high quality and you will end up paying more for your pizza; but; imho; it is worth it.
AN9sX6Dh8-QAoJssdyno8A,SNdy7KsTDkCgLL19b7Uumg,fYrtmvzqZYsORMsw0sjeIw,5.0,This place was great!  We came in on a Friday evening and were able to sit down right away.  Mateo was our server.  He knew the menu well and seemed to like everything on it.  After some deliberation; my wife and I ordered.  She had the pizza burrata and a grapefruit cocktail that was really good.  I had the Ragu Nepoletano.  The pizza crust was PERFECT!  Seriously; it had just the right consistency and the smell and flavor were spot-on.  The combination of fresh tomato sauce and cheese was excellent.  My Ragu could not have been better.  It had a combination of beef; pork and sausage.  The meats were tender but not over cooked.  The pasta was al dente and it was baked with mozzarella on top.  Very tasty.  .Mateo; our server was attentive but laid back and ambiance was comfortable.  I recommend this place for anyone staying downtown in Phoenix.  I will be here for two more days and I plan to go again.

Highly recommend the smashed potato pizza; definitely the best thing on the menu or their skinny dip.  I am so sad they do not have their half price food after 11pm anymore; but their late night $5 menu is just as good.

The parking lot was empty but the sign said open.  We opened the door and ALL the chairs were up on the table (closing time?).  But the sign said closing wasn't until 9/10 at night...it was 3pm.  There was a sign on the counter that said the restaurant next door would take our orders....o...k.......So; we head next door.  Again; there's another but it says dining closed.  (WHAT the hell...??)  Someone came out to greet us and we said we wanted Hot Dog Hause.  The poor man seemed distraught.  Apparently; the girl was cleaning...something; blah blah blah...They let us sit in their restaurant.  We ordered from the Hot Dog Haus menu.  Food came out minutes later.  Hubby didn't get what he ordered which was the Desert Heat instead he got a Nacho and Jalapeno dog.  NO idea what happened.  Whatever; ate it anyway...Food was alright but I've definitely had better dogs and I could've done better myself.  ..Well...guess that's our future hot dog eating venture...do it yourself...Where to next???

This Wendy's is so ridiculous it's almost humorous. EVERY SINGLE TIME I go they screw up my order.

Great service; delicious and refreshing drinks; as well as the cutest interior. I got the Thai milk tea w/ boba and it was perfectly made. The boba was chewy and soft; made just right. My mom had the pina colada slush and she was very pleased with it because it was just the right amount of sweet. However; you have the choice to adjust the sweetness levels. The owner was there when we were; and showed my family and I great hospitality. He really cared about his business and customers. I've been to a lot of boba places here in Vegas and Tea of Joy is definitely one of my favs already. A very well deserved 5 star rating. We will definitely be back!
4GXII-GU7S0ZyU6ElkhscQ,WSBYu6pr_careGSP97APgQ,WfbJhWrwkYMjz3YSpcMd-w,4.0,My family and I ate our Thanksgiving dinner early around 12pm . We decided we wanted to take a spontaneous trip somewhere so we decided on Las Vegas . ( we live in so cal.) we started checking prices on Expedia and came across Hooters being the cheapest closer to the strip. It was $60 a night. The hotel is as nice and clean. They also have great customer service here. The hotel isn't like a 5 star it's just a simple hotel. It has a Keurig although the coffee cups thingys tasted old . But overall a good stay better than the motel 6.
nUpKKVwG2WctMOXux19vew,m7zhLQyIiaDR1Q9r__rp6Q,MVh2LqT_TEfeYYPC_muMtQ,4.0,You cant go wrong with salt and vinegar wings; a cold beer and a good game. This is one of the hubs favorite places to go and I thoroughly enjoy myself as well. I was amazed by the quality of the salad I ordered. I expected your typical run of the mill restaurant side salad - iceberg lettuce; some onions and ranch. But this was amazing. There was a variety of greens and even some extra veggies tossed in. Love it.
eBxQzBFLEPwRCxuiL50SQA,6q2kW2a50uAPK-cnpcNo5w,ajdgBRjvYhwl_9OgR9hzRA,4.0,OK this place is very good. Have the flank steak was absolutely delectable with some really cool fries. It's not the least expensive that I have run into however you will not be disappointed with the quality of the meal

ljLq8ZTLO52rzwsEeaWZKg,sHyX2ETuv7ubGcV8MI3IfA,ENZLPlKj_BuBbHvpT9zfCQ,5.0,Went here for the first time yesterday for food and drink with my wife. We had heard there's an open mike on Wednesdays from 5:30 to 7:30 and we ended up staying the whole time. Good food; cold beer and live music. Mostly oldies from the late 50's and 60's. Performers came up for about 3 or 4 songs each and then a finale with multiple musicians. Especially good guitar and vocals on Beatles; lady doing some Johnny Cash on her Gibson acoustic was very enjoyable; etc. Just a good time with friendly crowd... my wife and I really enjoyed our time there.
5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ,ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A,WSF3O5SZOdEbw1wGqAPOxA,4.0,The chicken parmesan hero here is also worthy of a mention as it is very good and in true NY style it has lots of mozzarella cheese and sauce surrounding some seriously good chicken cutlets. The bread is quite fresh too and just order ahead to avoid waiting as it takes 15 minutes.
tcfL9_Qe-12eX4rdmK_6XA,e0Jn0ZjqL-dWi7Brs0bbmg,ay4_X0DFw4QN8YqsZ4ltZQ,5.0,Very good service. I can't believe they have amazing lunch specials 7 days a week starting at $5.50. Yum.  We will definitely be back.
84WYW7OfV-IXUJk95EL5_Q,B-KS9atQu-gw51QTee-jpg,kgOsR_t5oKkbNf5jfUIn_g,5.0,Excellent salad bar; superb meats; get ready for a food coma. Each night they bring around 8-9 differnt cuts of meat. They usually ask if we have requests as well. Great service. Yes; it is a bit pricey and I would go a lot more if it weren't so much.
mmazCP1ZH0QsUqDS6OivFA,33h9Jv4VKbbxB42CUD9WQg,lZbWpGAZeNauErHQ3SxLUw,4.0,Joe Beef came up on all our searches while we were planning our Montreal trip so it was in our must-try list. We didn't have a reservation but walked in around 6 pm and got a seat by the bar. It was tight but we managed...There was no printed menu; which was slightly annoying to be honest. I get the whole bohemian approach thing but with my questionable eye sight; it was hard to read what was on the chalk board. After a lot of  questions directed at our waiter; we finally got our order in...First to come was the foie gras double down.  We got the half size to keep things relatively sane. This is one of their staples. It's basically bacon & cheese; topped with chicken skin mayonnaise; sandwiched between deep fried foie gras and drizzled with maple syrup. Maybe basically was the wrong choice of word. It was as decadent as it sounds but while it was good; it wasn't something I'd order again. In all that richness; I didn't find any umami that resonated in me...Next up; veal tongue with artichoke and red wine reduction sauce. If you like tongue as I do; this is a good dish to try. A lot places tend to overcook tongue coz... well it's tongue; but not here. The red wine reduction sauce was as good as any I've tried and the artichoke balanced the dish out nicely.  ..One of the dishes I had to try was the lobster spaghetti after I heard my friend gush about it during his visit here a few weeks before mine. The creamy; buttery sauce was cooked with the head of the lobster and tarragon. It seemed to hug the perfectly al dente spaghetti and the soft pieces of lobster. We had to use all our will power not to get bread to mop up the remaining sauce once we were done with the spaghetti. There was no shortage of umami in this dish...Somehow we also ended up with tomato salad. How did that happen? I should thank my wife for insisting we get some veggies. The salad consisted of red and green tomatoes with shaved old goat cheese. It was a welcome change in the program...While we sat at the bar; I was trying to decide on a shot of whiskey to whet the appetite. I saw a bottle of Wiser and told our waiter that I'd never had it. Canadian whiskey is not something many restaurants in NY carry. Even though I just wanted one shot; he poured 3 - one for himself and insisted that my wife have one too. He did charge us just for 1; so I appreciated his hospitality. ..I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal but wasn't easy on the wallet and the meal was very heavy - though the heaviness was a recurring theme throughout our trip. But hey; a little extra cholesterol never hurt anyone*...*Not a medically proven statement.
avkOIpslBUFZMQhELpl3JQ,kUNAJ_AXGz6aBmIwH_NruQ,_iSzwJOuYjK9-SLeJqodMw,5.0,I wish they didn't close the one location we have in Illinois. I love this place for the variety. You are your own chef. You choose your own ingredients; so only you can really mess it up!
1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA,vVkT25eBjh-93j7w08OWUQ,QkQTj3RUb4qQptST8sjHWg,5.0,Great place to eat; staff is really nice; and great view of the praying mantis with the antennaes that catch on fire. Went twice on our trip. Definitely a repeat.
ogmjK0R0K9vpPTfhNKrXzg,CW2C9Y37uHzipsFXIU3dYg,qRe4ah1w5M1DjV2jHiZXUg,4.0,I love Rising Star! One of the best cups of coffee you can get in Cleveland. They are located in an old fire station... So it is a fun place to go. They have great coffee drinks. They roast their own beans and use local milk. They have some pastries and sweets that are great... Again local. The only draw back is there is not a lot of seating.
LGZPjmhEg2QYeGZ2PKnpQw,42aIqqLHAJeQRMVwZKcFdA,2YVGWu1e_5SeH7wqaVYAfw,3.0,This place had relatively good food; but the prices were ridiculous. We spent $100 for 7 for LUNCH. The service was slow; but the food was good. Also; they charged $11 just for tea. .I dont I think I would go back there. They service dimsum; but it's not in the traditional way; where people go around pushing carts asking if you want what they have. .The style of the place was really modern though. It had a mix of chandeliers; accented white ceilings; and yellow abstract opaque glass dividers in the VIP section.
fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA,5p0OtGmTaN94C0iFSf_STg,swmgrcUsBCVBkdKMeWtpfA,4.0,Frankly I avoid buffets at all costs but I was both starving and in a rush. Awesome value for a buffet. Lots of great surprises too. .While much of the food was standard Indian buffet quality; several dishes were way over the top better. Wow. .It's always a relief when the meats are tender. I was pleasantly surprised to see lots of attentive staff. .All I can say is take lots of little tastes on your first go around. You will find several items that warrant a second or third visit. .I really wanted to give them 5 stars so I ordered a Chai. It was OK. .Definitely worth a visit.
DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q,y-tcfs5mEmPpmdoiFx1XFg,zreOyAlRE7MlPsccNA8QGg,1.0,For an establishment as highly ranked as the W Scottsdale; I was very disappointed with the food at the pool and the breakfast both served from the Sushi Roku kitchen.  The food was unpalatable; over garnished with lettuce; and sub par for a restaurant anywhere.  When I returned my food I was told that they know that the huevo ranchero is bad; but you know how proud chefs are of their food... Huh! Interesting...
2Yq-Y-tDroP7mdDfcWJLCQ,SMBVhgdvsPQAoX4HZ8fP1A,VVJCfGkJSEkxOy_UFzxsvg,5.0,It's not scary; just go in.  They have the most amazing fish tacos; quesadillas; mexican hotdogs; seriously the whole menu is awesome.  They also have the best horchata. I've never had horchata with walnut pieces in it before but it works. YUM :)
3NgDynF6R3aBFhrKwusfQQ,v42rTyTd3q-IH74IRxZ__A,0htaGgDsarxMa1Li842uFw,4.0,Just under $20 including fries and a drink.  Jones sodas are in the fountain. Fries are tasty...and WOW!!! The burger is delicious; looks like an advertisement; and the bun is soooooft and tasty
y0x795PyDX8JL_oyIaTUiQ,BtqUS-BZCWmtA3Rbpq6r6Q,T_avPEW5XiPPxct-3TeAfw,4.0,Love this place! Never a line. Waitress was genuine and service tip top.  Had blueberry pancakes.... Yum!  Food is good all American fare. Portions are really good sized!  Price is very reasonable!!!
xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w,Xb0efePWImK310epUpnNAQ,Qrqvss_f5oVv-BSTKVvXgw,5.0,My husband and I came here on a recent trip to Las Vegas.  I was torn about which Vegas steakhouse to choose.  ..We decided on this one; and it was a great choice.  We went with the chef's menue; middle price range.  Our bill was expensive; but it was so very worth it.  I was not crazy about the calamari; but I don't like calamari...so; I don't hold that against them.  My husband loved the calamari.  I loved everything else; and so did he.  If you love food; steak; wine; try this place. ..Oh yeah; service was wonderful.
WwrKHFXpBqLQAkhmU01Xvw,JwJTXIGd99kzo-RHMhfjBg,CXGTx1ofdPLzTsEswEwuOw,2.0,Was craving Bi Bim Bap so we decided to try this place out.  Didnt like it at all.  No flavour; didn't really have the crispy rice at the bottom and had no spice even though I asked for it extra spicy.  We also ordered a dragon roll which was not very good.  Way too much rice and the whole thing fell apart when you touched it.  The service was not great either.  We had to stand up and wave to get the bill even though there was only two other parties in the whole restaurant.   Not recommended.
SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,12AzaKnyko99WgDYn30u1Q,cagzaDRjN3EL0p6LyxCx0Q,4.0,We went here for a girls night to celebrate a friends birthday! Live music and good food.. The raw oysters and mussel were great! We all ordered different a thing including the rainbow trout; fish and chips; and the steak! The monkey bread was really good! Highly recommended if u want a laid back dinner with good food!
oKCPpuBN2QHBoRV3Tc6-3A,DK3wX1znJf5xf9eZI7H8dA,wzZZXFb8H0ektNnil2jRTg,1.0,Terrible location! They mess orders up. In one day they messed my the same sandwich twice! Which I had to drive to get it. After the 2nd time I called and requested to be delivered instead and they could not accommodate. I just took the loss. Save your time. Worst Panera.
uBdYMY6a6A7FyxzTSwOiDg,ACMqt4v66qlFh1ag8TtxLA,eI-0DH1L63DnBA6Dw94yuQ,5.0,The food was fabulous; but the service was even better. They cared enough about quality that when my husband's ice tea tasted old; they tracked it down to an old filter and made fresh. It was such a great place to start our Saturday. Thank you; Kitchen Table.
GqsmNL8t4rauN9lRQGK8Iw,33vxk9eTFWcM4yWfyqw_KA,ZfGDnxKiuy6GkGfSQ5hjUw,1.0,The door was locked at 8:30 with 10 on the door. Chicken came out of plastic and from the microwave for the teriyaki bowl! With sauce dumped on top. The only thing that was cooked was the veggie decor on top!
7dKIMvsTQI6zO-NYdRmrwA,LUo124iqFxWhj2UuWk2dlw,4Cj7X6pmbcdC2sBsuAViTg,4.0,I decided to give this place a try. We had a coupon so why not?.I ordered the fried cod and chips and my husband ordered the mahi mahi. We a few shrimp and some onion rings as well..The decor is simple. The place felt a bit warm inside; but it was clean. They have an all u can eat fish fry on fridays.  I just got the large cod and chips plate. It came with 2 meaty; crispy pieces of fish and I did not care for the chips.  But then; I am not a french fry gal anyway. The fish was not greasy and perfectly battered. The tartar sauce is ok. a bit on the sweet side. My husband really enjoyed his mahi mahi with cocktail sauce. I thought the cocktail needed more of a kick; but it was fine.  I LOVE the garlic onion rings. It is a must if you go. Every table had a order of them so i figured they must be good and ordered them. I am glad we did! The dipping sauce is tasty too! If your in the area for some decent grub. Stop in. The service is friendly and the gal at the counter was helpful if you had any questions. They also serve curry;pasties;sweets and much more.

The food is always delicious; they make it fast; which is great when I'm on my lunch break. I love the jumping noodle bowls. They always are polite and warm when you walk in. Very important to me; the restaurant is always clean! I love this place.

aZLggARpUrEpdalQqPUI0Q,a6edJQpI-MEg-OUTKDp3HA,omX3qJeoy7_W7O-i2ChQyA,5.0,Oh no! We just found this place yesterday!! We are in trouble!! Amazing drinks and sundaes. I had a quake shake with mint chocolate chips. Very relaxing and easy to get in and out. We decided to have a seat and enjoy and I left with a bag of chocolate.  A good quick fix if you cant make it up to SF. Service is great!! Very clean and well stocked with all their items you would want. Very Dangerous!! I will stopping in again for their cocoa.
K3J4zvnQ_G1d5xfffPf2Wg,IRk6pmalOn7fHXgTTcFjvg,oPiWLyWfNqHc5Vn_6N_fRw,5.0,Good; cheap; healthy! Thats how they sell themselves and that's exactly what they are. It offers a good alternative to the everyday routine and a relaxed environment
Amo5UhXRFce_fegUnFEnMA,l0jejmRcICSPYudZ8wEYmQ,HizfUO2Kw9BTj7QoUaca4Q,2.0,Positive: battered and deep fried green bean fries are novel if; uh; way overpriced and tasted like they were fried at a carnival...Negative: what is a thick slice of raw onion doing in their signature patty melt? The whole time I was thinking; somebody better complain about this because this is way gross...Please someone comment or message me a suggestion of a place that I don't drop $14+tip for a patty melt and a side and then hate it. I would love to do a positive review of something because hitting misses is unsatisfying.
R8TSCE3fqfDBLAx52jGGgA,ZQ-IEk8-Eer6CUQ5QxoOww,kHHgSUH-aYxg57SPwOzA4g,1.0,The food is either awesome or very mediocre; its a bit of a luck of the draw as to which cook is handling your food. Even that has changed dramatically since they've recently significantly reduced their menu. The worst part of coming here really is the awful service. No matter what location you'll go to; you'll be dealt with profound disinterest and any complaint you may make in person or attempts to contact them will be ignored. There are better places to go to where you'll receive better food and better service that are easier to reach.
Bg8xZT4-NsYLYd-WPIhgXw,d6JltKIeAbPj415bwSm7eA,_ctVHjQTjDCZdKI6nOWk1A,3.0,I was not too impressed by this place overall. Maybe my expectations were too high; but either way the food was just okay. I ordered the chili cheese dog and side of fries to share with my friend. The fries were pretty good and came in a larger amount so it is perfect for sharing. The hot dog just did not have the crisp that I wanted and the chili just did not have the flavors I look for in a chili. My friend thought they put too many onions on hers; but I liked it that way. I think I might give this place another try and see how I feel then.

I1qRb4qqQRly7NhIOCkk_Q,u9bjjZY_83ydwgRtbVzYvQ,Zu1vBxEdU0_4GS_VKr_DKg,5.0,Best burger I've ever had in Ohio! I got the 7th heaven burger and the red onion jam that came on it was delicious! I only wish they'd put more truffle butter on it. There was a small dab; not enough to taste the truffle in it. The burger itself was cooked perfectly to medium rare. I got the regular fries but wish I would have tried the truffle fries. My husband got some kind of burger with a fried egg on it and it was really good. He only let me try one bite because he liked it so much. The beer selection is great! Lots of craft beers. The only thing I will warn you of is that the dining room is small so get there early or you will wait and there is no waiting area. The price is high but I knew that before I went. The atmosphere is classy but the staff are laid back.
EVpjpTaSUdeXG0b69krzAQ,Xfza0iFwJQEC8ECWpj-RqQ,cCTPC6fep7COMOITev1trw,1.0,I love subway and it's usually pretty cool but this time I felt kind of off. That guy Armondo or whatever yelled at his employee when he didn't even seem to have done anything wrong. I just felt as if it was very unprofessional of him to do so. The sandwiches taste good tho! I hate that what could've been a great meal was only okay due to this bully. Julian was nice. Will return to subway again but most likely not this one
dPbvWt-6YVxtGkeh7f9JpQ,I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,JFzrHPf5KeUgsvO6U0nvEQ,5.0,Decided to give into the color red and eat at Firehouse subs for lunch. The store is very welcoming who does not love anything having to do with fire fighters anyways. I ordered my lunch at the counter with a very friendly and patient cashier. The menu is very easy to read and order from. I ended up ordering the Firehouse steak and cheese. ..The sandwich itself was so wonderful and the meat as usual cooked to perfection. The cook was a master at putting it together and while I paid extra for the mushrooms it makes the sandwich so much better. The decor of the restaurant is red in color and is very appealing to the eye as one eats. They have a tele in the lobby and the flat screen is nice and clear and great at distracting one as one eats. I always opt to eat in since the restaurant is so quaint and welcoming.
44kd3YdkhXj5XiSPs5XNjQ,Q_lFU4jK5DM9-FpoNbB6Kg,A0LUp7UuMV-VMuqNcazaJA,5.0,I was extremely surprised with the quality & atmosphere of this place! Decor was very nice and felt clean. I went for lunch. Calamari app was so good! Perfectly cooked; not over done. The roasted red pepper dipping sauce was delicious. Baked potato soup was made in house and the mirepoix showed that! Very tasty. I had the Reuben sandwich for lunch; flavorful and filling. Creme brûlée cheesecake was actually really good. It wasn't frozen like other places you go to and order dessert and can't even get a bite of cake on your fork because it's rock solid! My aunt had the peppered BLT for lunch and they put a lot of bacon; the way a BLT should be executed. Overall genuinely happy with the freshness and quality of the food. Staff was great and very attentive. Can't wait to try dinner.
GlwOGCjSzts7AnbK9gqmng,QU5oShGJtu9D_o3mDvmWCg,QhO66-wFeVFw83eSf5C19A,3.0,My wife and I dined there about a month ago. The service for us was ok; but three tables around us were complaining about something or another through our meal. The food was ok; prices decent; service ok. The mixed drink I ordered was very good; but warning people with we care about you so you can only order two seems low-class.  ..I think Cheddar's will always be about 2.5-3 stars no matter what they do. It's 'ok'
uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,7aZY24hn36HlEcKwdThOQA,Vme4q09CeRARrN1gkDPL9A,4.0,The best service; bartenders are the nicest women. Had a great meal at the bar. Amazing
Rx_ZwOPb6pusIXeLLrBUqA,pxOhbYTvc6IESU3Bpzs8Iw,rQMJYflNcMe7tgRF4ccpZw,2.0,After visiting the Faberge exhibit at the Mtl. Museum of Fine Arts; I wanted a quick bite to eat before heading home.  Had researched some local spots not far and Mai Xiang Yuan came up with good reviews; so I headed in that direction.  When I entered around 2 p.m. there were only two other diners there;  I was offered a table for two.  The hostess/server was not overly welcoming or friendly; but she did offer a menu and brought me a pot of nice hot tea.  I really only wanted a dumpling appetizer size portion but was informed they did not do 1/2 orders - so I requested the Lamb and Coriander dumplings (steamed).  There were 15 plump and delicious dumplings and I did manage to eat them all.  The plating of the food was very plain - no parsley or colour to enhance the plate and the sauces on the table were only soya and some spicy hot watery sauce.  This is just a small hole in the wall place; but tiny details can make a big difference in the enjoyment of a meal.   The décor is pretty tacky too; hanging red cut work Chinese lanterns from the ceiling and an annoying flat screen TV  with an Asian channel with people talking and eating.  The washroom was pretty dirty too:  dusty heat register; dirty waste bin and dirty floor - however the sink and toilet appeared to be fairly clean.  If the owners paid a little more attention to the cleanliness of the washroom; turn off the TV and play some nice Asian music; ask the hostess to smile and welcome guests and maybe add a smidgen of parsley to the plate and some plum-like sauce to dip the dumplings in - then I might return to give it another try.
uBdYMY6a6A7FyxzTSwOiDg,v31w9g9wf6wyG__-lOsUfw,VofITTUFd_uMBNkb10Y4Yg,5.0,We had a party of 12 for brunch on Sunday; we made a reservation ahead of time. They were very accommodating; we didn't have to wait long to be sat. The food was really spectacular; the monkey bread is to die for; a great choice to order as soon as you are sat and deciding what to get for your main meal. I had the short rib Benedict aka shorty. Egg was perfectly cooked; hollandaise was on point and the beef was super tender. Everyone in our party loved the food. They also have a great choice of Mamosa's. The only issue we had was the air-conditioner wasn't really working that day; so as you can imagine it was hottt in the restaurant. We will definitely go again; this maybe my new brunch spot in Henderson.

Granted I think this is simply an old Giant Eagle that they added onto to convert into a Market District; but still it is lacking the top-tier feeling of the other locations.

Best thing about it is if you have picky children they have the build your own burger...my son was happy that he could pick and chose off the BYOB sheet...
xVEtGucSRLk5pxxN0t4i6g,fR3M3MtKarPZD0DZqGqMhw,rx3usILgWqeI62afUvMuQQ,1.0,We came into the restaurant 25 minutes before they started to seat for lunch and the bartender told us that they would not be able to officially serve us until they open but we are more than welcome to sit back and relax. We sat for maybe 5-10 minutes enjoying the view and excited for the food that this restaurant has but then the hostess walks over in a condescending manner letting us know that once the restaurant opens she will have to seat us on the OTHER side even though there are no customers present other than ourselves. We asked her to clarify and again she was adamant that she will have to ask us to move even though we were situated. After verifying that we understood correctly that she wanted us to move for no apparent reason; we decided to leave since it was getting ridiculous. I am sure the food is amazing but the staff will need some training and social etiquette.
zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,f-GDcPTY8-eaqIIaE8OTfg,jRNc_2-szMRFSORjGhc_Fw,3.0,Don't come here expecting the same quality of food as NYC; although the portion sizes and sharing fees look familiar. The sandwiches here are good; but extremely expensive at $25 for most options. The service is hit or miss; great one time and mediocre another. I wouldn't mind coming back as the food is good; but the prices will likely keep me away.
xnVkYE3iMp_aZniiCIuD0g,WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,yK_xjtdHCxNBDbcWAZpf6w,4.0,Nice addition to downtown for the regulars in the old Fritters.  Good sandwiches; wraps; salads; smoothies and specials.  I have not tried breakfast there but they do have high quality food in generous portions.  Good turkey sandwiches.  Friendly service at reasonable prices.
OtAVXleSatkQeZn9Twg4Aw,-tCRfuS12ayAMo1SyudxYg,Y_1PHWetapzfRlowWZvh4w,4.0,Literally a couple guys selling gelato in a doorway; or at least that what it seems.  Easy to miss if you're walking by quickly; but so stop by and try. The gelato is good and the service is friendly.  Limited selection though.  And definitely no seating.  Still; Yum.

The fish is seasoned and lightly breaded and there is a good portion on the taco.  I have tried the crispy quesidilla and al pastor tacos; but the fish tacos remain my all time favorite.  ..It's very simple inside and not in the greatest neighborhood; but the service is great; prices are cheap and the food is amazing. ..Come and get some authentic tacos!!
3cbsPfoUUrysf-M8FI_0IA,ALwGPgaD29rP6WBvWvT3tg,blQ_v7Wcx8wlAEhuijFLzQ,4.0,Excellent; casual restaurant.   Great; creative food; and a wonderful atmosphere.  The menu seemed a little light on choices; but it also seems that it changes frequently; so I can forgive that.  Nevertheless; there was something for everyone.  ..The one thing that kept me from giving this place the full 5-star rating was that the corkage fee was a bit high at $6 per person.
vK1_qKEG7zHvjiTOsN0CRg,OClLMc1sEgtuUvDN5zQXxg,ReR_M54F2WtpLN33Jr1AnA,5.0,The food is absolutely amazing! When we walked in; nobody was there to greet us; then we were told to wait for a table that had been open the 5 minutes they had us waiting. The wait staff seemed like ASU students who went out to a party the night before and came in to work sluggish and out of it. The organization of the restaurant could be much better; but the staff was very nice and the food was great! Best pancakes I've ever had; fantastic eggs Benedict and green Chile hash. Despite the staff; my family and I would definitely go back again!
lIDgEB1HnKAq03H1fpjzLQ,nZViXVORQ8uSJY4kEzmcjQ,0nVW0-C3gkZN73BwN70mpA,1.0,While Bad Owl Coffee has a cute Harry Potter themed gimmick going on there is nothing magic about this mediocre coffee bar. The wait was way too long for an ok coffee. Also; I tried to order the nitro cold brew; which should have been a quick pour. Fair enough they make the drinks in the order they are placed; but after waiting for them to make drinks for three other people I watched the baristas struggle with the nitro spouts for 10 minutes until I finally interrupted them and said I would have something else. At this point the four people behind me had got their drinks and two more received their complicated latte drinks before I finally received my average iced coffee. The barista was apologetic about the wait but I'm not impressed enough to come back. If you are not in a hurry or don't care about efficient service you might like this place.
4C-qogCJWE5Or9yc-AUegw,YhKG0jWCmTM5ZWd5C-Xm1w,slI-yQy1RMbu16Bpxzw9hA,5.0,Their biscuits. The end. I have been here for breakfast and dinner. On the weekends in the morning it can get pretty crowded; but it's worth it. Grab some coffee and a country ham biscuit..  You can thank me later :)
c3ukNv4GHicrT6K9G2IW3w,ozuxWbGwcY_xxGho6Bkx7g,e5fccRoOnCgcjk868u6cTw,4.0,Best wings in east Mesa I also love their fried mushrooms and gyro sandwich. We mix it up when we go. The honey BBQ wings are good too. Next time your looking to eat some wings try the place out.
O5vXNIody0SMddowzrAMXQ,MmSoHx0Eo0ZczFES53l9zw,OMgusLcz6EvftkG3FaSxtw,1.0,Placed an order online; since there is no warning saying how long it could take; you don't find out until after the order is placed. Not only was I told it would take an hour and a half to have my pizza delivered; it still is not here and it's been another 40 minutes past the time it was supposed to be here. When I called to figure out where my order was; I was rudely told; yours is up next; so I'm guessing my cooked pizza has been sitting around for an hour or so. The girl who answered the phone told me reason for the delay is they are short drivers and that they can't take the time to let people know that it will be longer than expected.  Great customer service! (Please take note to the sarcasm here). Not to mention; never was there an apology for the inconvenience...Clearly there is a management issue here; how hard is it to figure out how to have the correct number of drivers and to make sure if one of your employees doesn't show up; there is a back up plan in place? Considering the other reviews I failed to read; it really seems like a management scheduling issue! The convince of delivery just isn't worth it here!!!!  ..I'm pretty sure in the franchise operations book there are scheduling help guidelines; so to the owner; you might want to read that. You could always contact your territory manager; the regional manager; or the operations team at Yum! Brands; I'm sure they'd be more than willing to help!
cUvCVDTnYosaf8dir936Ew,0QAE-h6YRJiRF5RraE29cQ,aBk7as8lGeeedOLZg2SUTQ,5.0,Great spot! Moved to the area fairly recently and noticed on my walk to work the place always busy. Finally got the time to try it out on Sunday and everything was great! We got in right away which we did not expect on a weekend. I got pancakes (SO fluffy!) and bacon; my boyfriend got the Egg's Benedict; both really enjoyable. Will definitely be going back again.

Best Halwa Puri in Greater Toronto Area; Excellent Nihari; great Nan's - Main Dishes try the Spinach; Kababs and Chicken Jalfraizi - it is worth your while to drive to Markham/McNicol and discover this gem of a restaurant

It's all so delicious and I like that they don't always have the same thing. ..The food has good taste and spices and it's hot but in a enjoyable way! I very much have enjoyed their soups and usually use a carrot stick to cool off my mouth.

0lpT5sj09vUfDp5zUBwjIw,8JvUGKKcTfAmkTBOmUIMzA,Y2Td708ZiGNneHzFL45Jqw,5.0,Amazing local coffee shop brewing up tasty espresso drinks and more. I don't do dairy so I appreciated that they had oat milk. The oat milk lattes my husband and I got were phenomenal and the vibe there was cozy and hipster. Prices were insanely cheap and would keep me coming back daily if I lived nearby.

OCnEbhm67cuatmb-AcEHkA,8B3hGCIDhKlK34EdDQUKEA,FqouvTjX1ZFRT7FKqduXuQ,5.0,I came here today to get some protein powder and some multivitamins. The girl working gave me great suggestions and was knowledgeable about the products. She let me know what she has taken in the past and the benefits that she noticed. She did not try to upsell me or convince me to buy a bunch of stuff that I don't need.
CE7o2uWmnUyTibMCa_R0Rg,AjcYVz9xp4MJ5LxeolQkNw,6f-Zg9hzfxRvOyqI_3gdmg,2.0,I was really looking forward to go to this place... and I've unfortunately been disappointed. The food has been all right; but nothing outstanding..The salads (small plate) were really ordinary. .The lobster raviolis; along with the sauce were good. The salmon was ok; no real flavor..For dessert; we had a coffee cheesecake; very heavy; and a tiramisu which was just a sponge cake with whipped cream; a kind of mascarpone and the presentation in the plate was horrible..The service was not great and very long. The diner took 2  1/2 hours for just a 3-course meal..I liked the feel inside. We were seated upstairs; the interior and the historic details are nice and make the place interesting to see..I found this place very mediocre overall. For the price; I definitely would go somewhere else. There are much better restaurants in Calgary....

S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA,TwC9BUdIZ6KoqoQeL0RyKw,f0HYXy3Mpveu6GbASAOciw,4.0,i've had the cognac chicken; fajitas and enchiladas here. it's not completely authentic; which I think is a good things... or; rather; this pace is more new-age Mexican fusion than your nina's Mexican cooking w/ ingredients they use in their specialties...The (fresh) tortillas are amazing and-my favorite quality of this joint-the food is always perfectly balance in portions. You'll never leave with puddles of extra-whatever on your plate staring up at you; all alone! Dinner usually runs $15-20ish; sans drinks. Only good mexican i've tasted in vegas.
1dhPgc7E7IzzpxjHM2LphQ,53ApJTgvnYlEPgP0xgc6YA,LRp27pS2cziZk0MbG3Cjvg,3.0,After spending a long cold day moving my college student into an apartment;; we were hungry and thirsty (not necessarily in that order!).  Mad Mex was a few blocks away tucked away in the south oakland student neighborhhod.  After a giant plate of nachos;  and a tall margarita; the world was suddenly looking brighter.  In addition to the tasty margaritas; I was pleasantly surprised to find they had about a dozen craft beers on tap as well. They were running a special on Bells; $5 for 22 oz;   I tried the smitten golden rye; while my  IPA loving husband had the two hearted ale.  they were both exellent and went great with the food.  The food itself was decent if nothing amazing. I thought the nachos were a little dry; the burrito was good though.  the menu is huge and there are a lot of vegetarian options. would come back;especially for the craft beers.
6W3hdaCjx_n1kADEuORduA,0wH8fLJ5upPqExGx5GkwCA,TtzeChxHcnEfL3WhSIbg4w,4.0,Service was great! Waiter was very attentive. Didn't wait long to take orders and bring food. The bison burger was incredible but the chicken sandwich was meh so I gave it a three. Great location and the furnishings were unique. Go to the bathroom- quite interesting. And when you're ready to walk off your lunch take a tour of the petting zoo.  Worth the trip there to experience the area.
iS44aNB5h7bkAV3dzm9Fgw,ytbvUdgVXpgEOWIt7HIFHA,RrHPruX1NaurDRutaEaMzA,2.0,Please note that this review is for the overall experience; NOT the food; which I would give 3.5 stars. ..I went with a friend last night and we had:.- papadoms.- butter chicken.- chicken tikka masala.- saag aloo.- rice.- garlic/reg naan.- coke/water..The food was very tasty but there were a few serious issues. Firstly; the papadoms were served with such a tiny amount of sauce it was ridiculous - I honestly thought they were joking. You could barely get the end of the piece wet! Then; the tikka masala was served in a weird sauce; closer to sweet/sour than true tikka masala. The butter chicken/naan/saag aloo were all awesome - expertly prepared. The main problem was the bill. 2 people; no appys; no alcohol - $85! I agree with Kitty S - at least on the value part. I won't be back - go to Jaipur Grill instead if you want high end Indian - better value for the money and food is better.
ejaUQ1hYo7Q7xCL1HdPINw,zgo6ehbfeMOcsG9bgofMNg,iHADDdUuclfB8V8ce-ZFqA,4.0,I love this place. It's so awesome being in there. It's just so cool. They've converted the pews into tables. There's a gigantic beer brewing thing at the front of the church (think where the altar would be.). Am I the only one that thinks it's hilarious that a church is now a bar?  I love it.  It's just such a unique place and the food is great; I've never gotten anything there I didn't really really enjoy. I've been here a lot but this one meal sticks out in my mind as the best ever. It was simple; a piece of salmon and mashed potatoes and I think spinach on the side. I also had one of the best desserts ever here; an apple strudel and vanilla ice cream. They really have a way of taking simpler menu items and jazzing them up and making them fantastic. Side note - their pizza rocks.
owLXnEhlMLsFpemYoOxNkg,cOgLx88zMnKGmaRTUS8iHg,Mq_-2JU22wa3CaVkQ69nyg,1.0,The Tuscany Hotel is absolutely the worst hotel ever! DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY HERE!! They are full of hidden taxes; and charges with no consideration for the customer. They force the customer to comply with their wishes without written conformation of whatever policy they are forcing the customer to adhere to. The language used is vague; and open to many interpretations; which do not lead to customer satisfaction in the end. They have little respect and appreciation for the consumer; and take pride in openly frustrating; and belittling their customers who complain. Do not fall for ANY promotion; or discount to patronize this hotel. Spend your money elsewhere where you will be appreciated and respected.

3qlqzQrwh8hjBltlgFgsJQ,hIG5qvEbM0qLavmUet7qNw,_EfPaoCLuV9CKELwMNaf0w,4.0,basically just wanted to drop a line saying that getting a pork belly taco and a house margarita MIGHT be the most delicious $7 you can spend in the roosevelt area.
FtaTjyMUIY457tPJahjg1A,_Bo366Mhx0T3qaI77BKpJg,LZe-06-puzht8TP_I3tDqA,2.0,Service is slow; coffee is water down and salad is stale; not fresh and soak with dressing.

I went with my family of 7; and everyone was able to get what they wanted from bacon to vegan. I won big points with my family finding this gem. My only suggestion for improvement is to have real plates and eating utensils rather than paper and plastic.
dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw,2wucmox9-J0uhS_LbReKjg,0jO3y4YegZDzzB7MyvldqQ,5.0,This is the best Chinese restaurant to eat off the strip if you're in Vegas for the weekend or just for a day it's a must go to. RECOMMEND: Deep Fried Spicy Chicken; Chicken Chow Mein; Yunnan Fried Rice; Lamb Cumin....etc everything is amazing. Some of the staff do not speak English but be respectful and bare with them it's worth the wait.
C8KNDYcHpVmrAcUpcZ7QzA,BnywXOmsaeNYIKJQWaQIlQ,Lg_aYZ7572hjoh1gb42tgw,4.0,One of those restaurants in Montreal where it's classy enough to take your date; and also casual enough for a good value meal while hanging out with friends and coworkers. ..Very classy decors; yet warm and comfortable. Spacious space with open kitchen and the soft glow of the warm lights on orange cushioned walls and white tabletops. We did the pick your own pasta option; you get a piece of paper and do a la carte selection for choice of sauce; meats; and veggies. Something fun to do while waiting for foodz - the tabletop is comprised of white paper and with the pencils; you can go wild with imagination. I certainly had a grand time doodling away on the paper. The time past by fast and the food came in a generous portion plate. The angel hair pasta is fine and al dente; with the arrabbiata sauce; slightly spicy and savory; was perfect. The shrimp was cooked to tenderness and did not retain any of its 'fishy' taste. ..Overall; it was wonderful. Though the food is not extraordinary - still delicious; the value; atmosphere and the option to customize the pasta dish was excellent.
BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA,RrLRd9M2Q6iYCNnKMZsdtw,mVgct_uzMfwIYhLKCd8hLw,4.0,First of all: their new address is 421 Spadina Ave @ College St. ..Second: well; I wasn't very sure about this dumpling thing when I got there with a friend... I ordered some kimchi just to be sure there would be something I'd enjoy in my meal. ..The waitress quickly brought a teapot full of a delicious jasmine tea. I'm a tea lover and couldn't stop drinking it. ..Then; the dumplings (some call them gyoza) arrived. I tried different versions - meat; vegetarian and shrimp; all boiled. I loved each one of them; and; for my surprise; at the end there was no dumpling left. ..I strongly suggest going there early if you are with a big group; because the place has not that many seatings. I'd go with a lot of people to order different types of dumplings and taste one of each! ..If you are a fan of spicy food; don't forget to try them with soy and vinegar and add some hot sauce. It's delicious. ..The service is fast and very good. I can't wait to return!
dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,VC97ZH1pnuQREwJxG1taRw,kyidoDQ1cswYgz-UFh0mgg,5.0,So I feel the need to set expectations. ..I'm a bit of a Plastic Paddy. Love me all things Irish and Pubs in particular. ..I literally stumbled into this place the first time several years ago. It was a dismal Saturday at the casino tables; and a friend (from Limerick; Ireland) and I were just walking around so we weren't losing more money. We saw the sign that read: Full Irish Breakfast; served all day. ..We were in. ..That day; it was just what the doctor ordered. Full Irish for both of us; and a side of fries to split (with curry sauce on the side). ..Waitress from Ireland chatted w/ my friend; and we drank a pint waiting for the food. Great atmostphere; very authentic - - well; as authentic as you can get in a mall in a Casino in Vegas. it is MUCH bigger than it looks from the outside/storefront. ..Anyway; the food was perfect; and brought our spirits back to 100%. GREAT FRIES; great full Irish. (with beans and tomato and mushrooms; b/w pudding; the works). ..I have since been back 3-4 times; including this past weekend and it never disappoints. I spent my 40th birthday celebration there with friends; and we looked through their iPad app menu of whiskey - - QUITE the impressive selection; ranging in price from ~$5 a shot to ~$800. Great servers; great vibe; great food; great drinks. Everyone has loved everything here:..Recommend:.1. Fish and Chips - - Perfectly fried piece of fish and those great fries.2. Avacado Toast (appetizer): Sounds strange but it's great. Toast w/ Avocado and red onion; balsamic and goat cheese..3. Corned beef anything: the cabbage; the potatoes and the meat are spectacular.4. Full Irish Breakfast.5. Deviled Scotch Eggs.6. Irish Curry - super flavorful and perfect portions - - do the half rice half fries. :) ..Also have done their breakfast - - non-full irish version - - and it's also really great. Corned beef hash and poached eggs; rocked. ..Having just returned from Ireland a few weeks ago and being able to compare - - I think this place does an amazing job given what it is - - the aforementioned casino mall pub - - and I will be back.
2jzM7PSeG8OwZ5EvocCpQA,IlZKVEmRztQtja-6y3rOaA,RwLnMWKnlxjytZt2etrMLA,3.0,It's a Chipotle. But; it is usually very busy. I've not encountered the issues others have with waiting on ingredients; or slow lines. I have been all the way to the door and felt the line kept up. ..The employees are OK. There are a few that stand out as very friendly. Nothing special for the rest...My two complaints; which are related: the noise and the staff's lack of hearing.  The music in this place is crazy loud. I mean; I'm hyped and almost angry after eating here; and trying to have a conversation with friends. (Music selection really su ks too; but eh.) And; this is probably why the staff behind the counter has to ask me repeatedly what I said.
MqIgMLUdD53r_dmx1goYJg,LaQGI8hLJ2YCMHW3sZ5XWw,tdvRpeTvtQG1yeyD4Prbbw,2.0,Tonight was not a great night at this Shucks as the Cigar smoke got to us as soon as we walked in the door. We went to a booth but still had to move farther back. The fish fry was not as good as a normal Friday as the fish was very Greasy and the cole slaw so dry that even the waiter agreed but did nothing to correct it. Going to stay away as this was our Friday nite fish spot but we are going to try some other places.

This had been the first time I had tried a burger joiny egg salad and it was really tasty! Try it on toasted sourdough for an extra layer of flavor. After writing this review I really want another one right now :D
eNsM5ezjhPQWI6XlUGrUhw,EFfQZFfWWlxZ4ckTJdBLtQ,bI_4y5cHw_dyrENGcZSHCw,4.0,This has become our go-to Chinese/Pan Asian take out place. Yes; they do have in-house dining; but the atmosphere seems meh. However; the food is spot-on. The chicken fried rice has become my husband's new favorite. We both enjoy their Bento box options for lunch and dinner. I usually get General Tso's chicken; but recently branched out and tried their seafood soup to my delight. I'm hoping to explore more of their menu in the coming months.  Also; LOVE that they have online ordering; however it does take longer than calling or picking up yourself.
eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,rXXPk4WSXsmJkm81j5PbMw,WYC80PPwis0v2DSajtrlNw,2.0,I am extremely disappointed in the food here. What used to be a great place to come for drinks and appetizers; has turned into a place of undercooked food and lousy atmosphere. Our chicken was raw; the shrimp mushy and potstickers were horrible.  I would not recommend this place and I am a local.  Overpriced and undercooked!!
h58IV-LbmpycdzlwVhUhgw,yKpde1fJH2onIArKUmx_IQ,_Djg_6pkZzH3uf5-2hpGCw,1.0,I have gone to Granite city 4 times; each time getting the same results; no matter how much I wish it was different. .          The opportunity for them to succeed is there; both with the demographic and the theme; but the service is deplorable. Absolutely zero passion from the servers; they act as if I am an inconvenience to them because if I am paying I demand what I am paying for..         As for the food; it is fantastic on paper; however they fail to get the basics; hot food hot/cold food cold. If I order mashed potatoes with gravy I don't want it to be warm; I expect it to be so hot I have to wait a second or two for it to cool off to eat. Bagged salads? With the prices as high as they are I demand something more than a stemmy; brown; wilted salad. ..       I really; really wanted this place to succeed but being in the service industry myself I am not going to return. Every place has problems; whether with vendors or staff members; but those problems usually get fixed. The same problems persisted over the course of 4 months. The same problems persisted with 4 different servers and 4 different appetizers and 4 different entrees and 12 different cocktails. .       The good reviews I read on yelp ring untrue as being either hired to give good reviews or as actual staff. I know what I experienced and what everyone I have spoken to has experienced. Occasionally even a blind squirrel will find a nut; but not at granite city. .      I will recommend anyone considering granite city to just go to TGIFridays or Melt

They made tortillas right in front of everyone and they have table side guacamole. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and I'd put this one pretty high up there!
5xTHY_U8jn6MnXJMOSH69g,zejQj99sR-Y9-rq_xpL9nw,C_EhTTR953EalJ0dQzwaXA,4.0,Oh me oh my !!! ..I was a ramen virgin; unless you count instant noodles; which I don't. Kenzie took my ramen virginity. ..In all honesty I have not much to compare Kenzo too; and I am no ramen expert; but I must say I absolutely loved it ! ..The soup was filled with plenty of flavour; if only I could pronounce the name( so I won't try) the Gyoza I had was better then any gyoza I've tasted; so I would definitely recommend getting that on the side to share while you have your ramen soup. ..The service was great; they were friendly and kept checking up; refilling our water and they were super friendly. ..9/10 in my books only because I feel like they need a bigger space to accommodate their clientele :)
1ylgrtS3iSNaf3V68kw4bw,ffk63Mfiar0KoMgrCokVqQ,yRaxk_I2Dbc9bA21gL1epA,5.0,Dad & I went to dinner on a Saturday evening around 5:40PM; we had a 20 minute wait.  My dad ordered a lamb fennel soup and I had the beet salad.  Both appetizers had a hint of spice and were seasoned perfectly.  The main meal for dad was Chicken & Waffle.   I had the Scallops w/ mushroom risotto; fried shishito's & red beet coulis.  We didn't want it to end; the food is that good.  In the past we've also had Hanger Steak; Braised Beef; Salmon.  You can't go wrong.  Also the wings; burgers & sides are amazing.  There is something here for everyone.  They also have Gluten Free options.
ZfbwkAOnMguL_znvv_uJZw,zwsVQwyxkz-s4rvBCaPyZw,5Rhwmo9yO9-Tg4k2KCqmKg,4.0,This is a new restaurant inside the W hotel - at 7pm I was the only patron on a holiday-Monday..Good crusty bread (but I had to ask for it) and nice rose wine.  The Seafood Paella was prepared different from what I am used to seeing but it was in a good creative fashion.   It could have used less Andouille sausage.  The décor is very modern with many mod-paintings on every wall.  I can't remember what I ordered for dessert - I vaguely remember it was dark chocolate related (since that is the only thing I like) and that it was good.
W035pMPJuocijd0BLfHaiw,7PVY7A7Top7ButcfLkTJTA,WmQcl9FeKq_1Rhd1cbj_eA,3.0,Second time I have been to this place for beer and wings. The beer is really good with tons to choose .  The wings have been a real let down . They are really wet and soggy and greasy.  I ordered garlic parm extra crispy ; we got wet soggy garlic .  The blue cheese is really really good but they need to focus on getting the wings right because the consistency sucks. Maybe; if you get drunk enough you won't notice. Service also is soggy like the wings.

Finally I found this gem! I first tried out one of the Walmart Markets and their produce just wasn't cutting it. Smith's has got very comparable prices and great produce! The employees at this location are super helpful and friendly as well! .Best of all; by obtaining a Smith's card (for free from a cashier) you can upload electronic coupons to give you an even greater discount on featured products. Every Friday you can log into your account and download a coupon for the featured free item of the week! I will not be ashamed nor lie that I look forward to this! By using your card you also rack up points each month that will give you discounts on gas at Shell stations! Double win!!
wNnPxpAOCBk2N1KTJ2PDCw,grhsxNtVkm4nRiPPU0AVSw,vBe36-j0ewpsEC9dXfzHpA,4.0,I really love this place...The cupcakes are sometimes good and sometimes great. Once I had a gingerbread cupcake that was to die for. I think it had a hint of lemon in the frosting. They pretty reliably have vegan options. Once they were out of vegan cupcakes and gave me a free vegan chocolate chip cookie. You would think that a chocolate chip cookie could not step in and fill the shoes of a cupcake when someone had cupcake in mind; but that was a damn good chocolate chip cookie...What really makes me a fan of Dozen Bake Shop is the clever design and completely comfortable atmosphere. The owner and employees are friendly and often chat you up. I could spend a considerable chunk of time hanging out with a laptop; a cupcake; and a soy latte that does not disappoint; and I'm not one to do that a lot...Also; the strawberry lemonade: hell yes.
ebTvBxSStI9Vf5Tpux_X3Q,Nnt_lN31bp3EuuudFXIbDw,7sindbV5KRCuk_l4zBzJGg,4.0,First off let me tell you about the population that tends to stay here. I look around and I see retired /elderly couples on walkers; motorized wheel chairs or what have you. I see families straight out of that people of Walmart site. ..What you don't see are hoochie mamas with dresses riding up to their coochie; or dreamy international guys ready for a night of dancing. Unless there's an event causing those people to stay here i. e. mr Olympia or that cross fit games competition with cuties; cuties everywhere. ..Knowing that;  I stay here every time because it's off the strip and slower pace. If you're tired of the strip but still want to be close; this is the place. The members perk are easy and the rooms are decent and affordable (I'm too cheap to pay $100/night to be surrounded by beautiful people that would never talk to me because I have no game. Look but no touch)

RAEY1h0WidFtpTm8eGhVHA,P0J2H0XoJmcPzdwtJUHLcQ,3X4Q0wCC7N4x7CxIteDHGQ,5,I've been to Auguste in Sherbrooke and I'm so glad the Inverted Poutine is now in Montreal because of this place! ..We went in for brunch and our lack of reservation got us a precariously placed table by the door in the back room but we were seated in a few minutes nonetheless. ..The menu changes every week and it is recommended to order a few sides for sharing and one 'main dish' each. We started off with the heavenly Inverted Poutine then; I got the Salmon Pavé and the hubby got the Omelette with Herbs. My salmon was cooked to perfection and the dish itself - with the sweet potato; toasted sesame seeds; sour cream and a leafy salad - was so simple yet so unique in flavor. In short it was amazing! Hubby's omelette was nice and fluffy with a cheesy middle - another simple yet delicious dish. We ended our meal with something sweet - I got the Spicy Chocolate Cake (it was a strange concoction of a dish) and hubby got the Mille Feuille with Butter Scotch (this dessert is in running for one of my all time fave desserts). Lastly I also tried the Green Frappé - it had avocado; lime and spinach - it was pretty good.
rCx_rBhGjBK2tcESLpLEhA,RZUrmsaUiFKmZQvxuuk4UQ,BkrFBJKXjJKk-X7g-MVgrw,5,One of my favorite bakeries in Montreal; right accross the street from my home. I am really lucky :).I buy my breads from here. My cakes as well. And end up having quick bites for lunch/breakfast very often. I really like the staff here; very polite and attentive. .If you are looking for delicious event cakes or some good breads; this is the place I would recommend you.
rCx_rBhGjBK2tcESLpLEhA,C1DkRol0ZJkrnUynYcLoAA,boTFyz8njPoY4mGHjerbyw,5,Really an amazing restaurant! I had my first breakfast in Montreal here. Sales are enthusiastic and helpful; moreover; the food is really delicious!
rCx_rBhGjBK2tcESLpLEhA,YZHTcdH3lKuJIDwqI5oDxQ,YwHEXr1cqLUDiTWvimP4Bw,4,C'est un excellent endroit près de chez moi; lorsque je veux du bon pain frais ou des délicieuses pâtisseries françaises. Bon rapport qualité-prix...Le seul point négatif est que l'établissement n'ouvre pas assez tôt: vers 7h30 en semaine et vers 9h00 la fin de semaine.
rCx_rBhGjBK2tcESLpLEhA,aNfG4yqETNKXNQgc2qTToA,AbC60uqihIWxILLiz3igLQ,1,I have given this place multiple tries before writing this review. However; their dessert kept being not fresh; dry on the outside and overly sweet. .The server was ok; but their desserts sucks; don't waste your money here.
rCx_rBhGjBK2tcESLpLEhA,353SV5pZ_gkb9PTLmXVVyA,a_D-6QMkn_LJIIQDBMDZJQ,5,The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and are pretty fluent in English as well as French. The food is superb. They have the best quiche I've ever had! It's light and fluffy and flavorful and FRESH. The croissant was also amazing and the coffee was good. Free wifi is also available - just ask for the password.
rCx_rBhGjBK2tcESLpLEhA,3H5Ty7TV7SZvZLa1oTUGDg,Q5vJ2A9L__fQ3-3kOWLhkw,4,Bel endroit; calme; reposant. Le service est courtois et; bien que je n'aie goûté qu'au cappuccino; c'est le genre de petit endroit merveilleux où les produits sont frais et vous font sentir riche malgré leur bas prix ! ..A voir: Le présentoir à pain! Ils semblent tous être tellement délicieux !
rCx_rBhGjBK2tcESLpLEhA,1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,eXdz0qZhx_IHE2LAYvrmAg,4,Really cute and petite cafe on the corner of sherbrooke and jeanne-mance. It's always been the same staff everytime I've visited and they are very friendly. The ambience is warm and familial and I love going there to feel better or when I am homesick...They have a huge array of pastries and confectionaries. From creme brulée; cheese cake to fresh bread and homemade chocolate bar. I've had quite a few pastries from Les Moulins and have never been disappointed.  They have sandwiches and hot lunch as well. I like their coffee as well but the quantity is a bit small which makes the coffee slightly expensive...Definitely visit this place if you are passing by.
rRGuwyEzVj1xdUPZqyETow,ITZU9bz9CY_laMqK4hZrvA,eAP3x-JzmAw6fzvB8PeZAA,4,This is a really cool place.  Everything is fair trade and all of the products are excellent quality.  I have no problem paying a little more for something when I believe that it's made well and that it's to help those in need.  The prices really aren't any more expensive than most other boutiques here in middle of the city.
rRGuwyEzVj1xdUPZqyETow,sDEaKVCm36_3esWo1gu1Ww,zIw1Uy2INrgtQIPlYUfk-A,5,Excellent staff; super nice! Great selection of fair trade items of all varieties! I went in about 5 minutes before they closed and was  surprised at how inviting and helpful they were! They let me browse and even answered every little question I had! Definitely love the place; will be coming back!

-sHoW6Zdgctp8cxvzRIJ0g,im5YFrUXBVxSYtkxTCSdbA,R12Uk02Bd7WpJrXyoFsWbw,4,This is our favorite Portuguese restaurant.  Food is delicious; though service can sometimes be slow!  Make a reservation on a weekend night.  ..My favorite dish is the Porco Alentejana (pork with clams and little fried potatoes in a sizzling sauce).
-sHoW6Zdgctp8cxvzRIJ0g,9DJwzjOGCTJTvUMxgRXmrg,kD4C340PKVoodWCUCpXGCQ,5,What can i say; this is my go to place when i feel like having solid good food; good service and... Excellent bread with olives and olive oil..As a Moroccan; i love doing my bread in the olive oil. Their bread as well as their oil are excellent..One of preferred meals is the grilled chicken. Every time it's juicy; crispy and tasty. Ask at the same time..Guys take care of my nice plate..Come and try this place which has been part of the community for so long
-sHoW6Zdgctp8cxvzRIJ0g,OKSn4mjZ7xVOh7pe-uDGaA,LQ_ptxgP7bVc2MWpBOzl8w,4,I had the pleasure of eating here a few days after my horrible wait staff experience at Restaurant Portuscalle just a few doors down.  The service and food quality was a thousand times better at Casa Minhota!..The dining room has lovely hand painted tile all around.  There were about 6 tables of small groups and one huge table of about a dozen patrons all served diligently by ONE WAITER!  Everyone got their food at a very reasonable time.  Everyone had full water glasses; bread and olive oil; dessert menus.  This guy was amazing.  He was even humming and whistling the entire time...We started with the chorizo which was delicious and prepared very well...I ordered the house specialty grilled chicken which was very tasty and juicy.  The accompanying salad was lightly dressed and fresh.  The potatoes were crispy and flavorful...My fiance ordered the filet which was served on a very; very; I mean magma hot; piece of slate or some other type of rock.  The steak was sizzling as it was set on the table; and continued to sizzle for quite some time.  The steak was done medium rare but continued to cook on the table.  The stone remained hot through our entire dinner.  I even heated up some of my leftover potatoes on it.  It was great.  You could literally cook the steak more to your liking if you don't like your steak a little red.  ..The wine choices complimented the meal perfectly.  It was such a pleasantly different dining experience from the other place down the block.  When back in Montreal; I would definitely eat at Casa Minhota again.
-sHoW6Zdgctp8cxvzRIJ0g,AhUaj0youDpN-0MTttRg2g,u4Thkp_dnIzCf63AhXOPGg,4,Went here with a friend for her birthday and we both loved it. It's affordable; the food is really tasty; and the service is great. We started with a salad--the dressing was so yummy!! We ordered the house wine and Portuguese Paella for our main course. Loved the paella! The seafood was FRESH and the dish was well seasoned. The house wine was impressive--house wines aren't usually this tasty; at least in my experience; but this one was really good!! Overall; it was a pleasant experience; and I would definitely recommend this place!!
-sHoW6Zdgctp8cxvzRIJ0g,3qMRbKbezu5rPYJ6a2mEtg,ZABW0YotkdHJRIr5MlEiNQ,3,Service extrêmement lent. Nourriture bonne mais vérifier attentivement votre facture. On avait pris la table d'hôte mais on nous a chargé à la carte en nous disant que la morue grillée n'était pas le même prix que la morue fraîche ou bouillie. On n'y retournera pas...

-sHoW6Zdgctp8cxvzRIJ0g,UvSM45fAzgJp_edcEwaZWw,_46PYJb5Mp7stRmGBAQkug,5,We just walked into the establishment and was seated quickly.  I ordered a seafood platter which was amazing with the amount of fish and seafood you receive on a plate. The flavor was great and was cooked perfectly. Recommend this restaurant for those who want to enjoy some good seafood.
-sHoW6Zdgctp8cxvzRIJ0g,IgLCWlnYN86vgNr9-VsnuQ,TBhZwlEZKZz_DD0JKj1K5w,5,Amazing food; Joe really did an outstanding job at giving is a truely authentic Portuguese meal. From apps to paella; to fantastic desserts.  Thank you for a wonderful experience.
-sHoW6Zdgctp8cxvzRIJ0g,0rSY77NhhBi2ZCoJhwDMqw,iY7yGwc2sv0vL2vnMv3lyA,3,Don't be fooled by the simple facade of this place on St. Laurent. The interior nicely tiled and cozy and the food was delicious..We had a rack of lamb and grilled seabass steak. The lamb was a bit in th overcook side for me; nevertheless it was delicious with the thinly sliced potatoes and the minimum greens it came with. My dinner companion didn't finish her seabass steak; but I think it was because the sheer size of it. We washed the dinner down with a half liter of house rioja. It was a pleasant dinner.
-sHoW6Zdgctp8cxvzRIJ0g,IhvT5J5i1SSkpJpYgvHSGg,U4ateLkOVWS-ImiOJ3eKzQ,1,Well; that was kinda unexpected. We've been to this restaurant long time (about 15 years) ago and have very nice memories. So; being in Montreal once again we had no hesitation of coming; especially considering all great reviews on TripAdvisor (was this only our experience???)..Anyways; my wife ordered Cod Minhota Style; my daughter - seafood platter and I had Cod Lagareiro Style (grilled with garlic). We also had an appetizer; calamari..Calamari were actually quite good no questions there.  My fish was absolutely loaded with bones. I've never had in any restaurant fish with bones; it was appalling. In addition to this; it was a bit over-grilled.... read burned and swimming in oil; way too much of it...My wife's fish was very dry; almost shoe sole consistency under the layer of potatoes and sautéed onions... Only later (when we left) I learned how not tasty it was...Last; but not least; the seafood platter... I tried one clam from it and spitted it out.... I tried one mussel... it was cold... did it come from the jar??? My daughter said that shrimps; scallops and lobster were not that bad; but where did those cold mussels come from??..Once food was served our waiter didn't bother to check on us; though we did mention that we have great memories and so on.....Was there stranger in the kitchen?? That was really awful meal and waste of $140.... Never again.
-sHoW6Zdgctp8cxvzRIJ0g,8FDvj4dLNNF_6xWdGvqFgQ,nJj_SnH8Tqj-WMcg9-HAsQ,4,Good food; nice service and good wine. We will come back again even just for the people here. Recommend the seafood here especially the lobster and cod.

TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,7Ri5xkuj6rMvD8F2zjWFow,qnhUAHGX7fGzLxDPEWaGPA,3,I went there during hockey night; the place was really packed. Although since it is not strictly a sports bar; they do say that every CH game is played there on TV...Given my past experiences with other 3 Brasseurs; I was really amazed by the service; our waitress was very caring and the service was personal...The Onion Rings was a total rip off; if I were to pay 8$ for merely 6 onion rings; they better be plated in gold; soaked with unicorn blood and deep-fried in Lambda olive oil. It tasted nice; but still; onion rings aren't haute cuisine...The Smoke Meat Poutine was really tasty; the gravy was just on point and generously poured over their amazing fries. The Sandwich Euro lacked lots of seasoning; and the mayo was not evenly spread...We waited for almost 15 minutes until our orders were taken; but it happens during a crowded evening.
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,oHn8F-aeP5vKrDMVKDEvbw,pJyjHwKZHeq21VfOjlwW5g,4,While visiting Montreal; we ventured from our nearby hotel to catch some food and drink in a busy part of town. The atmosphere on the patio with nearby bars and restaurants make it a wonderful spot to visit. The food was excellent and the home make brew/beer is just as good! This is a great spot to people watch on a hot summers day!
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,DRDjrfODfL0a1E_NB6YKAw,2E79Cz0gxiwThtO7_2e-pA,2,Je n'y ai pas bien mangé! ..Les pâtes à pizza et flammèche ne sont pas cuites et la qualité des produits dessus laisse à désirer. Le steack n'est pas à la bonne cuisson; bref; la bouffe laisse à désirer...L'attente est extrêmement longue et c'est super bruyant!!!..On y boit de la bière c'est peut être la seule valeur sûre; et encore; quand on a goûté aux unibroues du Québec; la bière des brasseurs est un peu comme de l'eau. ..Je déconseille fortement; ou peut être les soirs de match avec des amis déjà bien entamés ;)
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,VYXa-WYWq8FaIUk_z1yj4A,jpuoOV31L1ew-8LLPRLT7Q,3,Bien que « les 3 brasseurs » soit à la base fameux pour ses bières qui sont brassées directement sur place; je parlerai plutôt de la nourriture qui y est proposée. D'une parce que je ne bois pas de bière (oui; je sais; c'est mal...) et de deux parce qu'ayant des origines alsaciennes; autant vous dire que je m'y connais en choucroutes et en Flammenküches! .Alors bien sûr; ils sont loin d'être au niveau des petits plats de ma grand-mère mais sur une échelle de 1 à 10; cela mériterait tout de même un 7. Mon seul regret en matière de Flammenküches est qu'il ne serve pas l'originale; celle avec seulement la crème; les lardons et l'oignon... Et SANS fromage gratiné. Mais bon; le reste des déclinaison étant très acceptable; on passera. Et puis leur paysanne est pas mal du tout d'ailleurs....Côté ambiance et service; rien à redire; si ce n'est qu'ils sont souvent victimes de leur succès et que l'endroit est généralement bondé de monde...
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,MQxmqXRq_VuIDcwmuVIgPQ,6DwOr4kaP6h7GEuYYcxHOg,5,1. Excellent service. If you have the pleasure of being served by a lovely bartender named Cassandra - then you are in good hands. 2. Great food. The nachos were good; and the 3 Brasseurs burger was delish! I had the blonde beer which went great with the food I got. 3. Free wifi; so if you're a foreigner traveling with their iPhone like me; then this is a great amenity. 4. Great place to watch a game. Of course they're mostly showing hockey; but they have a decent sized screen so you have a great view from most seats near the bar.
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,Rpo8fTYxlJN0anr5-qEzpw,7FgTrs_zd-VtF9Zj8MQ5nA,1,Service was bad; my friend and I were seated at a table for 4 and when the place got busy the server asked (not nicely) us to move to a table of 2. We didn't want to sit at a table of 2 because it was too small for the amount of food we were going to order; then the GM came and asked as to move as we were taking space; needless to say; we got the check and left. Never again I would go back because of the bad service. I mean; I used to work in restaurants so I get it; however if they asked nicely; we would of moved.. I don't know if this is a trend in Montreal resto to ask customer to move but this kind of request has to stop.
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,RMopAcH2eoiOuPkStfg_YQ,-7KNnQ4jjBlE6zwC1QXWcw,4,I've always been a fan of Les 3 Brasseurs; their food is really good; they have great beer as well. I've sat at their rooftop kinda terrace on St.Denis and it's so nice there! It's a good location to enjoy the summer; and the weather! I love how 3 Brasseurs is chill; you could go there for anything basically and it's nice for groups as well. However; I wouldn't suggest their sangria though; it was my mistake to get it; and won't get it again. It was more like a juice rather than a coctail. Definetely go there to try their beers and nothing else as drinks.
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,XOF4-BgGkYakGaNH1N5BEQ,kC3ADPzQ2PudZntc344qAw,5,Super à tester en sortant du cinéma ....
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,lzQLHoJdaMNwiNt76wrc4g,ZcrLYJVvVDkHUBZHdtIejA,2,This place reminds me of a Canadian version of a Gordon Biersch; but with worse food (if such a thing can be envisioned). The building and interior are great: Victorian industrial with massive riveted steel beans; dark wood; and superb design. You'd think it one of the finest brewpubs in Montreal until the corporate graphics and other chain-like signs begin to sink in. ..The beer is brewed on premises in this local chain (supposedly there are some in Paris; too). It is good; but predictable: better than commercial beers but not the equal of the better independents. The food is de-tuned pub food done badly. There are many superior choices for food and for beer in the area.
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,QE9wEE4MD6m20nlYHW4AFA,2W1hFOnVEEn9rQj8IerOUA,5,On y mange et bois bien; l'ambiance est assurée; le service aussi; et les prix corrects; le charme québécois en plus !
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,pOIRRUPezHeLmQrVFlzDDg,KMA__B9XT1j7mAVBacByzg,3,On Yelp; you don't really notice that this place is a chain; but we definitely picked up on the chain-y vibe while there. ..We enjoyed our beer a lot and it was very nice the way the menu explained each kind of beer. It made ordering much easier and took out the guessing game factor. ..The food; however was somewhat subpar. We ordered the duck Poutine; which was fairly tasty; but served rather cold.
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,xV81JGNzu5EA18Y_yYMa6w,IqdhvPp-bwVF8HlpGcg3lw,4,Drinkene var fantastisk!! Særlig jordbær-øl-mojitoen. Anbefales! Ellers har de også veldig godt øl å hyggelige ansatte :-)
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,O2wRqKDxpxP9bjtVJWlo3A,yWWQaz05sO3HZe6laJrLFQ,1,Extremely slow service. Food came out 30min later; but looked like it had been sitting in the kitchen for most of that time. Nachos we're cold; the cheese on top was crusty; not the cheese you want on nachos. The pretzel is very dry - do not order. Just don't go here! So many better restaurants within one hundred feet of this place. If you go here and end up having a less than satisfactory experience; you have only yourself to blame.

TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,6s-g2vFu12OemhiK3FJuOQ,rkPcpSeJhVFHOdpAaW0FPA,3,Les 3 Brasseurs is part of an international restaurant chain. Friends and I were thirsty; so we stopped at this particular location (on St. Denis) randomly. The venue was fairly large; fairly random; and fairly crowded. Considering the crowd; our party managed to score seats street-side; where others were already relaxing and people-watching...Their menu was amusing; basically a faux newspaper; prices weren't bad. Our server was awesome; and even did a shot with us - there were quite a few shooters on their menu. A few of us had beers...If I lived in the area; I'd stop back in for drinks.
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,wfQpJt6cVX6oktkLCze2jA,dRaoZR1AmhWGC8iSNS5aQQ,5,My husband and I are big microbrew fans and really enjoyed the beers here. Food was great too. The menu also suggests food/beer pairings which was very helpful. My husband had the muscles with the brown; and declared it was the best brown ale he's had. I had the house burger with their featured blonde; which I also thoroughly enjoyed. Afterwards we also tried the white beer; and while it was good; it didn't have quite the depth of flavor as the others...I had tried to make reservations expecting it to be crowded; but they don't take reservations for only two people. As it was a Friday night; it was very crowded; but they kept things moving pretty well--we ended up waiting maybe 30 min; though could have gotten in sooner if we were willing to sit at the bar. Definitely a place worth the wait though!

Des écrans permettent aussi de suivre les games; au dessus du comptoir. .De nombreuses tables sur plusieurs niveaux (beaucoup d'escaliers) et une belle terrasse à l'étage couverte l'été; très agréable. .Vendredi soir donc beaucoup de monde; mais après 10 min d'attente on nous trouve une table en terrasse. .Le staff fait tout son possible pour servir rapidement (bientôt l'heure du spectacle !). ..Nous commandons une salade avec melon; proscuitto; mozzarella; tomates; balsamique ainsi qu'un burger au chèvre accompagné de sa salade verte (frites au choix). Une pinte de blonde des 3 brasseurs. Classique mais bon...Note: En général je prends la flammenküche en plat; toujours très bonne. Et le bretzel en entrée. Cela fait partie des basics de la place...Au final; nous sommes à l'heure pour notre séance et nous avons bien mangé; bon rapport qualité/prix.

TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,Hrhn-fks4vBTT39M-n0akg,g797-l2SZCdONHjLipyJ_g,3,Came with a party of 3 and ate upstairs on the open air deck. It was really nice weather out and we wanted to enjoy the last rays of sunshine. Our waitress showed us to a table that hadn't been cleaned yet so the table was still sticky. She also forgot to bring us one of our drinks...The food was decent; I had a hamburger (not the most canadian meal out there) and poutine (very canadian). It came out in about 25 minutes which really wasn't a problem. The food was ok...Service: not great.food: mediocre

TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,vfaiArUvZuFXv9aOxX--wA,K2jNrAqkOW4879RJrT75qw,1,What a joke!!! Horrible food and horrible service. I know the city was packed that weekend ( July 5th 2014) but if you can't handle busy then don't throw tables everywhere. First; we seat down and after 10 minutes the waitress came in. Took forever to bring our drinks ( only soda) and everything was wrong. The food took near 40 minutes and when finally came in; it was cold; not cooked and all over the place. These people should be ashamed to run a business like this. Many people around us left before finishing their plates; and we did the same. Will never go back and don't waste your time going there either. We left very upset.
TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,C416RqFkejkCCsFLwHGj2w,ox247ZRjogqF8eHiv3PhqQ,3,The atmosphere and service was great but the beer was quite terrible - I don't think I'll find myself here again unless meeting up with others!

TgjgHz-QRrv60QKYZ-qmMg,vpldxbdbHIWdtm3CU49bsA,NkqIutW6FdzIwdgKnpcvwQ,1,The epitome of disappointing. I ordered nachos and never received them. I was the first to order and this was the only thing I ordered. My friend ordered the steak and mushroom pizza and it was dry; bland and cut into odd shaped slices. Another friend ordered a plain burger that came in the form of a hockey puck in both flavor and consistency. We had to flag down a server to get someone to take our drink order. Sure; it's Thursday night. It's fairly busy. So is every other restaurant and I will take my friends and we will spend our money someplace that knows how a restaurant should be run.

u8_eItt-BtloA6u-MbukAg,qKpkRCPk4ycbllTfFcRbNw,fhtvq4zNAAMcT5e8H2RTmw,4,Cleanest place ever ; the items are very well organised; a good few selection of vegetables and and extra products for your cooking time. The interesting part for me its the food ready to eat like tacos 3$; and sandwiches salades etc with the westmont budget you must be ok ;)
u8_eItt-BtloA6u-MbukAg,Gkxe9U9E2WR2937cjIZboA,L6hqOip1nxuIHGWk-2QXwA,5,Service 11/10; fish selection 11/10; seating 11/10; fun creative restaurant food 11/10..Was not planing on stopping in or eating here til I walked by and saw a little sign that said fresh lobster rolls and fish tacos..The tacos were only $3 and each one is made to order with a complex array of pickled and spiced vegetables; some kind of home made cumin contraption of a sauce and a fresh slice of mango!! It was summer-ie it was fresh; complex and delicious. Easily the best $3 I have ever spent. I can't say enough good things..The lobster roll was also made to order; but a lobster roll is hard to get wrong and hard to reinvent as your own creation. It was fresh and delicious and reasonably priced; but it can't hold a candle to those AWESOME fish tacos!!
u8_eItt-BtloA6u-MbukAg,glCZpRr0LSMssbkOYGXpbQ,VXK8-IdABwwVK4xN-6aS4A,5,This is a cute little shop that helped me out when I was hungry and the other stores were closed due to the holidays. I had passed by here once or twice and decided to step on in. They have a huge selection of fish; but I was dead set on getting the fried calamari. Their sides are amazing: so many sauces! I opted for the grape leaves; but believe me; you have to be there to see it. Yum!
u8_eItt-BtloA6u-MbukAg,yML2P1evj7FrLncIgaFzHw,KXDrkHohP7FS3Sr7nCJ8qQ,5,Walked in today for the first time in search of scallops..Lovely large store; amazing selection of fish and seafood - I'd go back in a heartbeat.    This place is pricier than other places but the scallops were huge and amazingly fresh.   8 scallops cost $37; so you've been warned.....they aren't the sort of thing you want to burn at that price!.Lovely staff; the owner was in the place chatting.....very nice environment; extremely clean and it didn't reek of fish - it's absolutely worth a visit!

uHSmRkzznq0GpWXWuvzuhw,1dwJK21zm7cuhUKdROWJXQ,ciG2MAZzz6nm8TVtGNnMHw,1,the other review on the page on this place is pretty funny because that was exactly what I was going to say.  Why did I eat that.  There are a lot of good Chinese restaurants here.   I was walking past;  it was easy and fast.  I started to eat it and kept thinking it would get better.  My stomach hurts.  That was not good food.  I should have thrown more of it away.
uHSmRkzznq0GpWXWuvzuhw,JbIgJ46QTSQUmtX6l07ZDg,falElDrIMhIKlcGxhcgaZg,3,There are lots of choices here for a make your own noodle box. And the portion they give you is large; no one in our party could finish their box. The extras; peanuts; lime wedges; cilantro; etc. all cost extra so be wary of how many boxes you're ticking. You might end up with a much more expensive lunch than you had planned. ..For a quick place that serves OK Asian food go here. Especially if you like being in control of everything that goes into your meal. Otherwise; head up the street to Chinatown.
uHSmRkzznq0GpWXWuvzuhw,oJegBeUvDYYFEEgZ26qWPA,KW-yx-5QzpTnfKpdPVGdlQ,2,Meh...the portions are decent for the price and we liked the concept but we both thought that the noodles were overcooked and the sauces were not very flavourful.
Vbel5f68Vn1_Ys7r4KZfYg,YpZLzACFXQJXGdG9kO7fjg,NuCJJjgpU8hfxol2Iq_F_Q,4,We had a really; really good dinner here tonight. The service was excellent - attentive and helpful but not overpowering. The food was tasty; presented well and accompanied by some nice side dishes. I definitely plan on eating there again.

VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,vuLaxanwjklmnRDKSqql2Q,-udUOIkjLVvxdosOUbWzag,4,Something to try; especially if you are a chocolate lover (although don't spill your whole hot chocolate on your pants like I did...) .We had a really sweet waitress and overall enjoyed the experience.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,5DLeXZ3ghivbgacb7OVW2g,-RICP5mj-x-9w9vfqvy1fg,4,Cuteness overload. The front is a chocolate shop and the back is a restaurant good for brunch. The smell of chocolate wafts through the air leaving you hungry for sweets. ..Got the nutella and strawberry/banana crepe- portion was huge. It was exactly what I expected and wanted. My bf got the orange grand marnier crepe; which was good; but drenched in too much sugar. It was too heavy and I think I would have gotten sick from eating the entire thing (good thing he's a piggy and ate it all). ..The way they make the food here was like artwork. We sat by the open kitchen and watched the chefs skillfully drizzle chocolate on each crepe and decorate each dish to perfection. I think it was a fun experience to try it out; however; balancing a sweet dish with a salty one would have been smart.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,r0-zQoilb3AWaZRYlI9-cg,8W1udx7XsI94KmJkpXNpzQ,4,Great location; in the heart of Montreal's gay village. I literally eat myself into a chocolate coma every time I come here. Everything is amazing. Only downfall; and the reason for the for star rating; is that every time I've come here; my waitress usually ends up missing in action after the food is served.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,pMHrE3GC7xqs4cYHSsawQQ,k_9rBM6IBmbeU82KaQaQtg,5,Came here on a rainy day with my girlfriend after dinner. We thought it would be more of a grab & go or cafe style; but it's actually a sit down dessert spot--kind of like Max Brenner's. Fortunately; the wait was short and we were seated within minutes...I ordered the strawberry cheesecake crepe and my girlfriend got the Earl Grey Chocolate fondue. Both were solid choices; especially the fondue. Something about the tea flavor infusing into chocolate.....An extra 2 cents; if you are sensitive to sweets or have cavities; it's probably best to share something or find another spot. The portions are pretty generous and between us sharing 2 orders; it definitely left a 'too many sweets' after-taste in my mouth.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,OtmF6DLMToJ7cniDjU23Jw,_iHowcm67iWtDIYLyYND_w,5,First time at cocoa 70; it's amazing...I had the brownie volcano with vanilla ice cream and it was out of this world...loved everything about it...the brownie was moist and rich and the ice cream so creamy. I also had cappuccino; loved it!!!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,iW0B7dPTyVM1Sm52i0SFeQ,-C97D9uhNXVpu3KoogEsqQ,4,I had the half portion of the chocolate marshmallow pizza; and it is VERY sweet; but good! I went with 3 other people and we each had a slice and were satisfied. Although it would have tasted better if the dough part was crispier. ..I also had the grilled vegetarian sandwich; and it was extremely bland; I wouldn't recommend it!..Also had the Milk Chocolate Milk Shake - AMAZING! very tasty!..The service was EXTREMELY friendly!!! Very good service! Atmosphere is also really comforting and relaxing!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,MjqfukTWimz3D0w-cp5fDg,0EJIti0R7B-MR_lttGaqpA,4,A cozy place to go to when you have a sugar craving! It tends to get very crowded in the weekend evenings; so its preferable that you get there around 9pm to avoid the line up!..Everything on their menu is good... I mean how can we go wrong with chocolate!..One thing I suggest; avoid trying this limited time hot chocolate-earl grey drink; it wasn't that great.... see picture for reference. But any other thing on the menu is good!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,jcsfcCjyP9xzgR_DamsUFw,dH_juBMdTMcb0-6fOsF6yA,4,Excellent chocolate. Good place to have afternoon desserts. But sometimes u need to wait.

We had these lesser known local joints you would meet up  at with your girl and that was the only place in town like it. ..Cacao 70 is an old school style local business. They still write their specials on a chalk board on the wall. The wifi password is up there now too; but when you look around; there's folks having conversations; friendly staff that aren't up in your face...They still make a decent cup of espresso here...To my knowledge they don't have one in Toronto yet. Cacao 70 still belongs to Montrealers in that sense...The customer experience is legit. Cozy woody decor; lending the place an urban cabin vibe; the seating is comfortable;  background music isn't intrusive or too loud. You'll be comfortable here. ..You'll fit in just as well in your hoodie; jeans and joggers as you would after work in your business casual...As world city culture and urban nomadism spreads; I believe spots like this will become fewer and far between...The rate Cacao 70 is going; the shop always has patrons; they've already opened up a 2nd location on Parc; but make no mistake; it all started right here near Atwater; in this still slightly dingy part of town...What's the difference between C70 and Juliette? Everybody goes to Juliette; Juliette is where you're supposed to go...C70 is where you go if you know it. If you prefer; the slightly quieter; chill place to the  number one famous place...One day it might be a big chain with Cacao 70's in any city...Come try it. Look around; chat with the staff; ask and learn about their local chocolate...Enjoy these small; special moments while they last.

I had the Mexico choco drink since I am a firm believer that chocolate and chile go hand in hand. I recommend ordering a cup and just sipping it while you navigate the beautiful city of Montréal.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,GQ8Mbf8ZsDj5Qt8QWBFnxw,4,Wow!! Love this place; great vibe; perfect for desserts after dinner; whether you are on a date or with friends; perfect to satisfy a sweet tooth. Their desserts look really good; especially the hot chocolate. We got the chocolate fondue because we were way too full from dinner. Got a single order to share between the two of us; the triple chocolate fondue allows you to have three different kind of chocolates swirled in the pot. We had the dark; semi sweet and white chocolate. It comes served with pineapple chunks; strawberry; waffle bites; and brownie bites. I wish there was more varieties of fruits but it's still a good value at under $9. I'd totally go back.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,W2HOnMpyvGK09Th21RYqvg,Okp13VvJqc0qQL3vMAYjcA,4,Nice decor; nice staff. Pizza is way too sweet for my taste; but crepes and fondues are pretty good. (Good food visual) .I like to take their make your own parfait; portion is good for 2 people and not too expensive. Other things on the menu can be on the pricy side.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,0LJqfXPuK13iKd1YxEUqXA,B6fG_zj37Y_zcLGdGIdr1g,5,The smell from outside; inside. The amazing hot chocolate menue 'wine style* The only complaint is the waiting; it is very popular and shows a line up on a regular basis. Love this concept. Can't go wrong with everything chocolate!!!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,BGsgs7CIvDk7FSolKuy5GA,XL1-Y10TDtQ9ZdMQ_0axvw,5,AAAAAAAAMAAAAZING! That is all that can be said about this delectable dessert place. I had toasted my smores on the table; and on another occasion had their black and white waffle. ..Yum yum - n'uff said! You have to go and try it; but be sure to make reservations! It gets really crowded.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,OdWzVDCaOPlRlhDpae0xEQ,5yxzfBJatHfoM8No8Zvjmg,3,This place has amazing desserts! Perfect for people who are chocolate addicts. The portions are big and it's a bit on the expensive side; but totally worth it. But here's why I am only giving them 3 stars. Last time we went there in October 2013; we had terrible service:..When we came in; (which was out 5th time probably); the place was rather empty; about 2-3 tables were occupied. We sat down; already knowing what to order. We ordered; and then we wait. After 15-20 minutes of waiting; I noticed how it took so long since it was only one plate and we would always order it previously. Our table was facing the checking counter; where the waiters would usually punch in the orders. I saw our waiter going to the counter; and said loudly Oh Sh*t!! with another waitress beside him. She looked at us with a shocking look on her face; and walked away. Immediately after I saw that; our waiter came to us and said Sorry guys; your plate will be there in like 10 minutes; there's a problem with the waffle machine and he proceeded to give us the knives and forks; which they usually do right after we tell our order.  Obviously; I didn't believe him; I just knew it was pure BS and he simply forgot to put in our order. Also; I saw another waiter giving a plate of waffles to another table that came AFTER us; we waited 10 more minutes and left unsatisfied. ..Since then; we haven't returned to this place; since the waiter lied to us straight up and nobody else seemed to care of what happened. Service has never been the best there; and that day proved it. We understand it was a mistake and that these things happen; but we are a big fan of this place and we are going to the one in the village; which has better service. ..I would recommend Cacao 70 to anybody who loves chocolate; waffles and ice cream; this place is exceptional for what they do; despite of what happened! :)
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,zApKbZhc3Y2tZCqIDaSSPA,BZ2D0wfizDv7WyoL4zF6Jg,5,This place is amazing! I had the Nutella crepe and the Mexican Chocolate. It was soooo good! I definitely recommend this place; it's a must try.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,qtfWl4609n5WYjWUTyWRyA,PMB-tpTiRjblr7LxyaD5vA,2,Was originally directed to a poor table next to the cash; asked for window; then was asked to move from it.  Ordered a vegetarian sandwich; sliced tomatoes and spinach; chunky-melty white stuff.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,2Ar0ZezNC_pk9GHr7fsx2Q,3NyMYNMO-sFShTxqkfiHQw,5,Love love love this place.  So glad they are expanding now; such an amzing concept.  Chocoholics heaven...The  chocolate is sooo rich so pace  yourself.  I know the menu is super hard to choose  what you  want; and everything looks so good but I would recommmend only  a few chocolately things in one sitting. ..Great date place; with awkward  chocolate fondu mess- very sexy. ..Recently had the nutella ricotta pizza; love how they pair some things you don't  normally have with chocolate.  I would love to see more unique twists and combinations; more spices etc. ..Of course to really experience it you have to  get a Cacao;  so many to choose from and then  you make it just the way you like it with the  right chocolate type and  milk ratio...Of course  most of the chocolate drinks are super duper rich  so you  will be spending quite a while here to enjoy them; perfect for a cold  rainy day.  I know alot of first timers feel weird asking for a to go cup to take their cacoa but it's totally normal.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,o9qSsU-zzbHbUt0Gbtj9fA,A7UYLeB8ZxT3T61tpIRPvQ,3,It was pretty cramped when I went. Food was ok but the presentation was really nice. Service was decent too.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,wpzE_HQNei1DNqOjfJxAkg,4,Now as I am not a chocolate lover *GASP!*; I don't quite have the capacity to fawn over the majority... or almost any of this menu. BUT; I do know that the staff are knowledgeable; friendy; and that the atmosphere is terrific. I have seen cute couples enjoy the fondue sets and have an appreciation for their tea selection. The menu is about 90% chocolate so I found myself eating a Turkey sandwhich; and although it was a little over my usual cafe budget; it was soooo tasty (blueberry AND cranberry sauce - YUM). You can't call yourself a chocolate fan if you've never been; please have the s'mores so I can live vicariously through you!..Food:  8/10.Service:  9/10 - friendly and informative; personalized staff.Price: 9/10.Atmosphere: 9/10
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,vp4XZ6af2fSyUGK2fpBczg,U33KsBObIN-F5m5yn0cBtg,2,Dont call crepes from Brittany when you obviously don't know what it is. Greasy and flavourless. Plus some clean would be nice considering this is just above the kitchen.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,KBEf4j6hl0A3d2lrU0GLxg,4,I stopped in over the weekend and with the unseasonably warm weather we had; I decided to indulge in an iced coffee and a dark chocolate crepe. Although the crepe was thin; the unctuous dark chocolate sauce made it more than enough for a light meal. The combination with the unsweetened cold coffee was perfect and it left me wondering what the other menu items would be like... I'm sure I'll be back in the future.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,-o8qqlFjEDq849SQEoqhcQ,CBeaanc8EV8Y2kZwZbaDow,2,Went here on a weekday around 4pm. There were only two other customers; and yet it took 15 minutes for them to take our order. The service is pretty nonexistent..We ordered a Nutella crepe with fresh fruits: raspberries and strawberries. The crepe was TERRIBLE. Both my boyfriend and I are French; and he is from Brittany (where crepes come from). This was not at all a Breton crepe like it claimed. The crepe was very thick (almost pancake like) and VERY rubbery. Really the worst crepe we've ever had. ..My boyfriend ordered the hot chocolate. He said it was really good; but not hot.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,fi38ETFUNBBndrkKqLqUtA,Gxl7cHOPYem2reV-TWO4ZA,4,After visiting Cacao 70 twice; I can say I was quite pleased by its food and atmosphere. They have a broad menu with an interesting variety of chocolate drinks; food (waffles; crepes; baked goods; ice cream; etc.) as well as smoothies and; for the ones who would prefer eating a proper meal; sandwiches and salads. Their brownies are moist; fresh and warm; and their hot chocolates are rich and tasty; yet not overbearing. As for the waffles they are good as well but; in my experience; a bit hard to digest. ..I would definitely recommend this place for chocolate lovers and I am looking forward to visit Cacao 70 again to try something new!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,U7OcIYNvvWPqHVwZSIKdpg,2y-VbceiruzLBCecJX-ljw,5,The food here was actually really amazing. Some of the menu items seemed a bit strange but I do recommend you go with some friends to try it. I went for breakfast foods so I definitely say give it a try if you're feeling adventurous for breakfast or brunch
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,lYaYBLbktDkYw6Zgy3p_Ig,NvwpZapeeG_Q8XGjRa_-zQ,3,We ordered the cheesecake and it was a little disappointing.  The Volcano was great good amount of chocolate wish there was more strawberries.  The girl with the tattoos had a horrible attitude not friendly or helpful with the menu.  Please hire people who actually want to be there.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,9Q1vzegrFrhxSSVUnyJc4g,LJq4oqVvd0xoIpNFbT4e_g,5,Came here to try out a crepe and ended up having their chocolate stout. Really good food. It was light and perfect.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,XNdEk3LNbQr-nKyhcMPGRA,m3rz-mI-hZEdwgCh3aUjSA,2,This place was packed when I went. Tons of college students. The service was mediocre. They seemed to be having trouble with the high volume of customers...I tried a waffle and a fondue. The waffle was way too sugary and the ice cream was icy and bland. The fruit (strawberries and bananas) was okay; but overall it was just sugar overload. For how much you pay; I was expecting higher quality food...Next time I'll head to a bakery for dessert instead.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,oV1-DIvLuw0SYPuJJI82HQ,-RjxlSwWUWMpBIdos2DNdA,4,I am not a huge fan of chocolate but the place really gives you the choice. You can have a cup of single origin hot chocolate and it's fantastic. Deserts are amazing; waffles and crepes but too much of a chocolate at the same time. If u come to try every bit of something each time you come it's definitely worth it. Nice location. and place is very coz inside. As you can read I do not have a sweet tooth but for a chocoholic it's a place to go.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,fiz9Y2dagXIEq0w8FGOGnQ,n23Rfwr8f9su0aepI4CnCw,5,Oh yeah! This place knows a thing or two about good hot chocolate; waffles and crepes. If you're craving something sweet; you owe it to yourself to visit Cacao 70. My personal favourite is Cacao 70 Vintage Strawberry Shortcake for $10.25. The service was prompt; the atmosphere was good and did I mention their Grilled Marshmallows Cacao? mmmm it's delicious. I'm salivating just thinking about this place. If you have a sweet tooth; you'll be thankful you stopped by that place.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,ZSdZNYFxCZHhEYGJcaSpqg,5,If you're craving dessert; specifically decadent; good quality chocolate fondue; hot chocolate; and inventive waffle creations; Cacao 70 is the remedy. I think I've been here 10 times!..After checking out their new menu; my sister and friend ordered American-style hot chocolates; and the matcha chocolate fondue for 2. I ordered the choco-nut waffle; and immediately regretted not getting a hot chocolate when theirs arrived. (Though I was happy about this later on since it meant I wasn't in too much of a chocolate-induced food coma!)..The service was friendly and quick; probably because it was a Monday night. It was half full compared to on weekends; when the line snakes out the door. Our water was constantly replenished; and also note that they like to keep this place warm; perfect for winter. The best part is that when I asked our waitress if we could switch one of the matcha fondue pots for a milk chocolate one; she happily obliged. Two thumbs up for that!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,N-lvb4QYUAzZZU_1sVhbMA,OHpHHyCMUwnumGIvCL6pug,4,Spectacular desserts (the triple chocolate cake is to die for) and a wide range of delicious hot chocolate. Go there for the desserts only; not for the main courses.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,8NmE-WNUMtqzBlbPVuDOcg,u0PbNyN53KJil2NBvAWXzg,5,This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal! .(Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)..Absolutely amazing! I always recommend this place to all my friends who visit Montreal. This little restaurant is an absolute gem. The place is very well decorated and very unique. Definitely in my top 5 places to visit if you ever pass by this beautiful city. ..I always get the sweet chocolate experience for two. This place is the perfect place to go on a romantic date or have a great time with friends. What is more hilarious than laughing at each other with chocolate stuck on everyone's teeth? :)..I would also recommend the crepes as they are really tasty as well! To be honest; anything on this menu is good. Highly recommended and a solid 5 stars! Well worth it I promise you!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,pbYTgMQhU_dw4CI53YBhfA,uSvD9O3aAB4E7jvC7ZdEmQ,1,I've been to Cacao 70 multiple times as it is close to my apartment but haven't felt the need to review this establishment until very recently due to probably the worst experience at a restaurant yet. ..I went here with two girlfriends Friday night around 10:30 pm and was not surprised to see a line up almost out the door. We waited for around 30 minutes in line; drooling due to the smells and seeing other people eating. We were very excited to be having dessert here as one of my friends had never been. We chatted while we waited watching as some people left; starting to get a bit impatient. A waitress came by to take our party number saying it would be 15-20 minutes of wait time. ..After 30 minutes; maybe more of waiting we were seated by the same waitress who apologized due to being understaffed. That's when I realized that there were only two people on the floor waiting the entire restaurant on a Friday night. By this point we were very hungry and thirsty from waiting; but no water was brought to our table. This is where things went down hill fast......1. We had to wait 20+ minutes for water to be brought to our table and it was only after I had to bark down the waiter who would not look at our table as he passed it multiple times. ..2. After finally getting our water; our order was taken and food arrived shortly after (~10-15 minutes) but one of my friends had ordered a cafe au lait which we had to ask for THREE times before finally receiving a lukewarm coffee. No one came by to check how we were and we were very unhappy with the service...The waiters knew they were understaffed and it took us an hour and a half to be seated; eat; and pay because of terrible service. They didn't even offer to give us anything to make the wait more enjoyable nor did they make us feel like they cared at all. At one point; there was no one on the floor and that's when I wanted to get up and leave. This is the first time I have ever left no tip at a restaurant and it was well deserved...I can definitely say I will not be going back after such a horrible evening at Cacao. It is unbelievable to think that they were 'understaffed' on a Friday evening; probably their busiest time yet there were 4+ people in the kitchen. ..Beware of their terrible and rude service.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,Ao1fWpdW5DhGBIIcu7nVKg,60rFXt9Lb4enR-0wTBvb-w,5,Came here after the Parc location refused to take our order.  (I think my offense was being a 50 something American dad.). So took an Uber with my youngest son to pick up desserts for the entire family.  Staff was professional; courteous; and upbeat.  Food was amazing.  This will be our go to location for sure!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,jLCG0hZ1GSi0ueDdidPQlg,DRfbR4awN3cq_AeEWvyz-Q,3,On our trip to Montreal; my friend and I bookmarked this place for a sweet dessert experience. We had dinner and then gave ourselves a couple of hours of museum time before heading here for our lovely chocolate experience for 2. ..I am a chocolate fiend so I was very excited to come here in general and the atmosphere didn't disappoint. We were brought a bucket of marshmallow roasting supplies and waited for our plate. I took issue with a couple of things right off the bat. First; I know it comes with one milkshake; which as an experience for two is kind of lame; but this isn't a beautiful tall shake. It comes in a short tumbler and it's basically a tasting portion. That being said; it's one of the best milkshakes I've ever had...The other thing was that we were supposed to get strawberries and bananas; as per the menu; but we got pineapple in lieu of strawberries. It was fine because I love pineapples but it would have been nice to have been warned about the substitution...The waffle tasted a little weird and my friend pointed out that it was a little undercooked in the middle. We didn't really touch it. The grill for the marshmallows runs out so after that; play time is over. The dipping sauce was great and the crunchy wafer balls were as well. I saw a couple of other delicious chocolatey concoctions at other tables so I'd return to try those. But it's a lot of dessert even for two people.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,D2TKDU2eeCvAmD8q98zwdQ,4,ATMOSPHERE: It's a little cozy restaurant with a nice; clean interior. I like the cabin look of the place. The lineups get really long so I suggest making a reservations (if you have the chance) or come at quiet hours...FOOD: The food is pretty good. The first time I came here; I got the sharing sharing plate. If you're REALLY into sweets and are two; this is the plate for you. For me; it got way too sweet at one point. Me and my partner couldn't finish it... And we were two. The second time; I got just a smaller sharing plate. I would suggest getting the dark chocolate as the dipping option because it's easier to not feel overwhelmed by the sugar...PRICE: Yes; it's kind of overpriced but I think you're paying more for the service; the location and the type of restaurant this is. Nice place for a date; Valentines day or just a nice hangout place...SERVICE: The service is good. Staff are friendly and efficient.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,iPemyqGqb2bTzZpmLKwv3Q,lh6OXW4gQ0ezfQDyfMVYAg,4,Amazing dessert spot. Restaurant is almost always packed at night so get there early or you might have to wait in line! (granted the wait is never too long). Highly recommend the chocolate pizzas and fondues. I get them almost every time I visit and they're SO good. The chocolate pizza is definitely a sharing item cuz you might not be able to finish it on your own. The fondues come with fruits; marshmallows; brownie pieces and cookies so you can basically make your own smoore. Tried their chocolate drink once but it was actually pretty bitter so just a heads up to people who can't take dark chocolate that well (when they say dark they mean real dark). Highly recommend overall.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,zvFMi0vcy-Rc9KmcCFlLEA,UfaMawyXfdKonscBPosw6w,5,Large menu selection that's fairly priced. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Even after leaving my umbrella there they kept it on the side for me to pickup later on. We came at the end of the shift (11pm) and the stag was still friendly . Their hours are great here as o stated before it was 11 pm on a week day! Perfect for getting dessert. They are located right on Saint Cathrine street so it's not easily missed. The inside is cute and trendy; and very clean. You can smell the chocolate and sugar upon opening the door and entering. They also offer free wifi! Always a bonus I would recommend to anyone wanted good dessert in the Montreal area for sure ! It has all of the dessert types you would want in one place ; waffles ; icecream; fondue ; crepes; drinks etc.... Came back here again for breakfast and the omelets were amazing !! Also we had another great staff experience with having Alejandro!! He made sure our order  was made perfect; he helped translate the menu to English for us ; and was super friendly !!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,YYyQ7qPPU_TXmaQ7Q4u6nA,SLk9LLieTR2OoGRxGbFwNg,4,Friendly prompt  service. Clean restrooms. She had the 'lazy breakfast'; a hot skillet of scrambled eggs; baked beans; bacon; sausage (tasty); ham (sugar cured and not to my taste); potatoes; and toast. I had the 'blue mushroom omelette'; mushrooms; spinach; onions and Swiss cheese. It was very good and accompanied by seasoned; roasted potatoes and toast. The meal came with a surprise appetizer of fresh strawberries; pineapple; banana and delicious warm melted chocolate for dipping. We had planned to try one of the desserts for which they are known but were pleasantly full after our breakfast and will have to go back again to try the desserts and crepes. She had a hot Americano she said was strong enough to bounce a bull. I was disappointed with a weak nearly flavorless iced coffee. In all a satisfying way to break the night's fast and after a brisk walk back to the Sheraton; a pleasant morning.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,mBDD9QS1AISnJqxGgk4OVQ,AtC2Suqpfh-djWIhdVuvDw,4,Stumbled across Cacao 70 on our way elsewhere and decided to try it. So glad we did! Thankfully we weren't too full from dinner; but even so a single parfait worked perfectly for two. We got one with chocolate-mint ice cream. I was a little worried when it arrived -- oftentimes green chocolate-mint ice cream is lower quality than white -- but it was great. It's two generous scoops of ice cream (and they happily gave us another bowl so it was easier to split) plus a whole slew of toppings. We really got a kick out of the options this provided. We dipped the fresh strawberries and the chocolate wafers in the hot fudge to create a mini fondue; as well as experimented with the various toppings in different combinations with the ice cream. The hazelnut crunchy bits were wonderful; and the brownie -- a very generous portion -- was excellent both plain and with the ice cream.  ..The missing star is for the price. This place ain't cheap. But it's definitely worth it as a special occasion place. And I suppose it's good for our waistlines that most of us can't afford to eat here regularly! ..Sadly we didn't get the hot chocolate samples other people got; but there are numerous varieties; including several types of cinnamon and/or chili hot chocolates that I can't wait to try. Discovering Cacao 70 is making me look forward to my next visit to Montreal even more.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,zE49S2Em3l7vgIlvFzZFOw,LS3aPvEEfTKlzPDn8j3eWw,4,I still love going to Cacao70; but I think one thing I forgot to mention is the wait time. I was lucky that I only waited 20 minutes to get a seat. However; I was only with my partner. So  if you have a bigger group - it's definitely going to take a little longer. You want to take that into account. I believe the other locations (e.g. around Berri-Uqam) isn't as packed. But if you intend to meet here with a group of friends for; say 9pm; I recommend coming at least 15 minutes earlier...This time I went; my partner got a marshmallow and chocolate pizza; while I got the choco-nut waffle with ice cream. We always see people ordering the pizza; but I guess the idea never really sunk in to order one before. Definitely an interesting experience. Dough is basically pizza dough (I was expecting pastry) - with roasted marshmallows and drizzled chocolate. Mmm so good; but so filling. I don't know how he finished it. Especially since it comes paired with fruits and another mini-fondue of dark chocolate. ..As for my order - I loved the waffles as always. I also love the nuts on top - crunchy and sweet. The cream and ice cream melted really fast; and I'm not exactly the fastest eater - so my partner was taking bites here and there from my dish. I am definitely loyal to the Banana Split waffle - something about the caramelized sugar that seriously makes me drool. I do love how they also gave me fruit and mini-fondue though.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,et1ZZXdmCDQWGCeIeMQBLQ,0fmV3hYSejr9iDN_O0IlgA,4,Got the chicken and mayo savory crepe and the black and white chocolate dessert crepe. Both delicious! The white chocolate here is especially delicious!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,2f0z22RLYES9HpR4gp6lhw,L7TBXv443yW8cM3q5HMjEQ,4,I could have died happy after eating at Cacao 70! This was the perfect establishment to get my crepe fix when I was in Montreal on vacation...Firstly; let's start with the decor. It was chic and trendy with a touch of hipster; so I was immediately obsessed with everything they were about. Though the extensive line was a bit discouraging; my friend and I decided to stick it out. The wait wasn't too bad; but it definitely helped that there were only two of us. We seated right by the open windows; which was appreciated on a beautiful summer night; and we were given our menus that were a small example of what you could be served if you were in heaven. I chose the chocolate raspberry crepe; and oh my goodness gracious; it was sweet; tart; and absolutely delicious. What I experienced is what I like to call a food-gasm. It's exactly what it sounds like. I couldn't have asked for a better crepe to make my stay in Montreal perfect...Though the place was terribly crowded; I did lose myself in the food and found myself ignoring everyone around me. For an establishment to do that was quite blissful.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,-wUY9XLBzN6Ji8X3TM0QrQ,-MV16eh-E-4Q2HRYfnlcKQ,5,Posting the Byward Market - Ottawa location review here...Cacao 70 2nd Day opening - nice concept; thanks for opening in the Byward Market!!  Toronto next?  I think this would be BIG in Los Angeles Market - Irvine; Costa Mesa; Rowland Heights; Hermosa Beach; Santa Monica; Old town Pasadena??  maybe franchise it out?..This is a chocolate lovers dream cafe...no calorie count posting!!..Good service; by Adam...Loved the Chocolate Fondue...Good Luck Ottawa; hope to visit on my next trip...Get the Ottawa Yelp location updated!!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,vz-BTTzvcoUr30VbQFzxZg,xCMvSV0BkoWklya36KvxFw,5,We stopped here for dessert to take to-go. Being a chocoholic; I found it very hard to decide on what to order because everything sounded appealing. The server was so helpful and strongly recommended the chocolate cake. I am SO glad he did. (Do NOT be deceived; this is not your average chocolate cake!) It came in a cup (maybe bc we ordered it to-go); and it took all our strength to wait till we got to our hotel to eat it. It was HEAVENLY! Layers of mousse; cake; dark chocolate syrup (that was CREAMY); and other things I couldn't quite identify. The texture came together and just melted in your mouth; though the distinct flavors truly spoke for itself. How can something taste so light and yet so rich?! I couldn't stop thinking about that dessert for the rest of the day. A bit steep on the wallet for a cup of cake ($11ish after tax); but boy; it was definitely worth it! Would not recommend sharing! Preserve your relationship and buy your own! ;)
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,TVhb4DLjcpzJ_ydU-YfIsg,0FopbASAoxmSOsY-WSa6NQ,4,GREAT; superb chocolate and desserts!!..You really should go here...Docked one star because I showed up with a group of 15 or so about twenty minutes before they closed down; and they told me 'sorry; we're closed;' and then agreed to serve us takeout only; and not the full menu.  There's nothing wrong with closing when it's time to close...it's just that some places would go above and beyond instead; being more concerned about earning 15 repeat customers.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,6Lolatywf5Ve-L1TqYmvLg,usU9nDRs1hhpkk-V9wIBNw,4,On the pricey side however the atmosphere is cute and cozy. I've been here a couple of times and the service is A+...-Good for brunching.-The chocolate pizza is awesome.-The crepes are decently large and quite good.-Don't bother getting the sandwiches other things on their menu are a lot better and these are overpriced..It is a chocolate infused restaurant; so try something along those lines and dont be disappointed that their real food isnt up to your expectations.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,GuW2KU4ukHgbRNELCQo-xQ,mhc7wpKqegRUvdq84H_rPw,5,The best chocolate and brunch restaurant. Its a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy all kinds of chocolate foods including pancakes; foundues; chocolate pizzas and much more! Go check it out you wont regret it!!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,zS5k8UumUtOXO3ZTWHijTg,g6p3MTr0EvBy9kxhbSJnsw,1,I would give 3 stars for the food but 0 star for the service. A very small thing but they deal it so badly...Food：.Ice cream taste good， others are ok， but the waffle is too soft...Service：.1. A sign of only to go was stood in front of the door half hour before closing. Ok; I can understand maybe they want to close the store right at 11pm. Why don't they just change the dine in hours to 10:30pm?..2. About 5 minutes; the server came to give me the take out; one big plastic bag of kitchen utensils; a big box; a tray with 3 cups. ( I only ordered 1 waffle) Was he thinking that take out customers should take each piece separately?! His reason was the bag doesn't fit the waffle boxes. The take out items should be hold separately or horizontally in the bag with two hands. I only ordered one Item and the take out was pack in a weird way. He said he can not do any thing...3. I mentioned I can't take it like this. At this time the manager came and fixed the problem easily. All the boxes were fit in the same bag easily. So far so good. However when I tried to mention him what just happened with that waiter. He didn't want to listen and even said I am blaming his employee?!  ..I understand they all are very busy on dine in customers; but this is not the reason to treat other take out customer so so so poor. Not pack up the take out? Not listen to complains？Won't won't won't go again.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,jNW6ilXeyCu1aYvcB03CqQ,OZzA_7_nbg6DYnlHf9Nukg,4,Excellent restaurant pour faire le plein de chocolat! Il y a énormément de choix pour les dessert afin de combler les envies de tous. Par contre; les repas salés ne sont pas leur spécialité! En effet; j'ai commandé deux paninis qui ressemblent à ce que n'importe qui pourrait faire à la maison; c'est-à-dire du pain; de la mayonnaise; du jambon et du fromage. Je n'ai par contre rien à dire sur le service qui était excellent et assez rapide! Un arrêt nécessaire à faire à Montréal!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,VFeFtxBewjIBIifnvkuEmg,2,We ordered the banana split waffle as we usually do; but this time isn't the best I ever did...The waffle first came in raw... And the mix batter was still leaking out so we advised the waitress she said they will make another order. ..Few minutes after; the waitress brought it back; yes they did make another waffle but everything else were from the previous plate; you can see the vanilla iced cream already half melted. The worst part is; they really did made sure the waffle is fully cooked... It turns out to be over cooked. You can see the burnt area on the waffle AND the banana. Instead of a sweet desert it turns out to be a bitter desert due to the burnt area. See picture below...So my advice to you; eat the raw waffle.. Don't complaint...
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,AaNVt0_Y8q5h6O5Kmk5nMQ,UV9WO01v4IkMyPVdoNjLYQ,4,The fondue was a good portion for the price and really good; although some things look a bit expensive for what they're offering other things look like unique offerings. I personally would not spend ten bucks on drinking chocolate. The service was a mix of competence and incompetence depending on the employee.

VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,l683preTG0GIk9XMaHAUNA,Lv_wts4PcMMDEV5dT-I2Ng,5,This place is utterly amazing; I traveled to Montreal for spring break (I know crazy right?); but it was absolutely wonderful! My best friend and I would go here every morning to order the illegal waffles; black and white waffles; the fondue; the best lazy breakfast ever and of course the Costa Rica 30+ chocolate drink. I wish there was something like this in the states. :(
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,wU2jIEy-v2EasBYgTfIdbw,DuNBDrelg1_6lccR70znmQ,4,Came here for brunch. The portions were way bigger than I thought they would be! And I love how here's they come with fruits and the cute little chocolate fondues.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,7rtW3fT1AkD4Xdwhjx8XWg,NQDkk1vYamt-4yJr4J7_yA,5,This place was an experience! Absolutely enjoyed every moment spent here. The breakfast is large and decadent. Each dish comes with fruit and chocolate fondue- how fun! The specialty coffee drinks were fantastic as well. Definitely worth a visit; especially if you're from out of town.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,xU3sDPonLx1_w4t6wOOpdg,I59ShEoJV80o6dyfzKSS3A,5,The interior of the cafe was clean and organised; with lots of space in between tables so you can surely get some private time while dining there. Got the lazy breakfast and it was served with a mini fruit platter that came with melted chocolate on the side which was simply a treat. Coffee was pretty decent as well. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to have an exceptional brunch!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,qZeX1ZZkN7DXk10keuGOhg,_eWQBlv1x4ZsO4npvRvT-Q,5,What a little piece of French Canadian Crepe heaven!  It's a great little brunch and dessert spot located near McGill that seems to be a favorite amongst college students.  On a Sunday morning around 10 AM we were seated without a wait. ..Fickle as ever we opted for the 70 salad; the Italian sausage frittata and the illegal chocolate waffle. ..The salad is a mixed green salad with feta and tomatoes topped off with a poppyseed dressing. It was quite good though I wished I had ordered the dressing on the side...The frittata was hot; came in a cast iron skillet. It was savory and filling. I was barely able to put a dent into it. ..The crown jewel of the meal was the illegal waffle. I will admit I like my waffle crispier than that but besides that it was a piece of heaven. The bananas were transformed into a banana brûlée with caramelized sugar. The order of operations was to then dip the banana or waffle in a chocolate sauce or whipped topping then top it off with these mini whopper balls. Unbelievable!..They also have a dessert menu. No doubt we'll be back in the future. By the time we left it got quite busy so clearly this is no well kept secret.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,2aKdXLQX20PGpsqi9JsLVw,MceMv0P4_B9PBrHc3-_hWQ,1,Très déçue du service. Nous avons commandé une crêpe. La crêpe était froide; j'ai demandé au serveur si c'était normal. Le serveur me répond : bizarre; je vais voir c'est quoi que la cuisine peut faire... il revient 5 min plus tard et il me dit : je l'ai mis dans le micro-onde; veux-tu l'essayer? Encore pire que la crêpe froide et molle évidemment. Je refuse la crêpe. Il retourne à la cuisine et pendant ce temps on attends impatiemment... après 20 min; toujours pas de nouvelles.. on lui demande qu'est-ce qu'il se passe avec la crêpe? Il nous répond: ah j'ai annulé la commande étant donné que le chef ne voulait pas vous offrir une nouvelle crêpe ! .Bravo au super service.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,92_nAYdezMaehUs01Qwr7w,Tv8C_7um_thhd_xntXR9Ow,2,Very small portion for the double classic fondue! We didn't have enough chocolate to finish our fruits or our waffles! Very disappointing
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,cqgjW23FJyu5kFlRDN1CpQ,LSfeGKgb2G3jt3z8_ory2g,4,I stumbled on in here 7 minutes before they were done taking orders -- yes; I remember the waitress specifically saying I had 7 minutes left to order. I wouldn't call that the most humble welcoming; but it's fine. It didn't bother me much because I was too out of it to care. ..I ordered a nutella crepe; and just like anything involving nutella; it was amazing. The crepe was perfect; not burnt and not undercooked. The nutella was rich and they aren't stingy with their serving of it either...Cacao 70 is any chocolate-lovin'-sweet-tooth addict's heaven. You won't be disappointed!..Fuhrealz.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,KYV3TpJiJB2LGN9umfmsHg,d9U9pNnsQExG25vwYxa9zA,4,Excellent service; free samples; versatile menu;. I love this place...They offer brunch; and lunch special crepes as well as tons of dessert options. I actually came in for lunch; not dessert with my bf and ordered the special crepe called Rosbif with roast beef; cheese; and mushrooms. Yum! Very delicious. It came with a salad and I wished I asked the waitress what the salad dressing was because it was so good. My bf ordered a waffle with semisweet chocolate sauce; and a salted crepe. His waffle was not too soft; not too hard....just the right texture. The semisweet chocolate tasted great; it melted in your mouth. That's when you know it's good quality chocolate...Waitress was very attentive and I enjoyed the free American style hot chocolate sample. I will definitely come back again and try more of the desserts and drinks. (I noticed there was a chocolate soda!!)
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,hGJhZ6Z-sG5ux9yzZc406g,vPAphPBb_6iIdG2AP0cXwA,4,As a sweet lover and a chocolate lover I absolutely adore this place and have been there so many times. The chocolate fondue is my favorite but it can be a little too much for one. Waffles are just delicate with their ice cream but Their brownies are somehow dry and greasy.Last time I went the hot chocolate I ordered was just warm and not hot at all; and the servers were not very responsive... I was disappointed！
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,USSAze9NxGMSK4ZmVs7zeg,Pq6tlpVQet-up7JOOdQRGw,4,It's got a great hot chocolate called the bolognese with a hint of orange cinnamon spice. Delish. Is bit pricey but quite romantic. A plus for a chocolate lover.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,oy4IvG3EXIGxPUfg-75YUA,DJI1BfLY4LGUGipQXzOADw,5,To my fellow chocoholics - Behold! Paradise!..((Just a tid bit - when I rate a place 5 stars it means that not only was the service; food; and prices excellent; but the place instills the meanest of mean cravings in me. It means that after I'm done eating I already want to go back and order something else.))..That is what Cacao 70 did to me...I am a chocoholic - a cocoa Fiend. My phone is protected by a chocolate bar phone case - Just to give you an idea of my love for cocoa. ..I acquainted our waitress with my addiction. I ordered Mexican Hot Chocolate (rich chocolate with cayenne pepper to add to the kick; absolutely divine); Nutella crepe with bananas (very large portion; can be shared between two people - simply yes!); and a chocolate cake (the weakest link; but still delicious) - the waitress looked shocked and asked if all of that was for me to which I ecstatically replied Yes!. She said she had to forewarn me that it's a lot of food; but I told her I still wanted everything I ordered. ..She was right about the portion sizes - I had my work cut out for me; but I demolished everything. I was in Cocoa heaven. She came back later to pick up my empty plates and saw my chocolate covered phone and said Now it makes sense. She also apologized in case she offended me; but she hadn't...It's probably a good I don't have a Cacao 70 nearby; I'd honestly go broke and possibly gain 10 lbs a week. ..Great for groups - especially like a ladies night or a date night. Just order dessert - it's Cacao 70 - it says it in the name - stick with something chocolatey and I doubt you can go wrong!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,S_5WK1du4bLY9dlEY1PzMw,oKpN3TrBUprcxgwGOmV9EA,5,Bouffe - La pizza dessert au nutella est complètement démente ! Servi avec des morceaux de banane et de fraise. La pâte est croustillante et penche légèrement vers le salé; ce qui donne un petit duo sucré salé. Leur sélection de chocolat est impressionnante et très bonne. On vous offre le choix des pastilles de chocolat et le liquide chaud à verser; soit amer; mi- amère; et au lait. Pour les indécis; l'option vous est offerte de choisir des chocolats chauds prédéterminés. ..Service - charmant ! La serveuse était très charmante et serviable. Voyant qu'on hésitait dans nos choix de chocolat; elle nous a apporté plusieurs pastilles afin que l'on puisse y goûter. ..Ambiance - Un mélange de rustique et de moderne. Très éclairé; parfait pour conclure une petite soirée ou se réchauffer quelques instants.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,W8BS_cK7trqmdKV-TZDsiw,k-c3lVBoeKkP8L84B0nEpg,5,Great dessert place with plenty of options. Nice environment and good service. Ordered the banana split;  really tasty. Highly recommended.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,t1HdYXIzIuooNDXC09iiBA,vyxsZvrLMv5APG6jPqqTrw,4,Awesome place for getting a late night dessert if your downtown! We were super full from our dinner so we only shared something for the 3 of us. ..The menu is definitely for chocolate lovers! They have crepes; waffles; Sunday's; milkshakes; fondue; and everything else that your chocolate heart can desire! ..The best thing about this place is the first aroma of cacao or chocolate once you walk in the door. It's a small place; but you'll definitely get seated eventually if it's not a busy day. ..We got something called the strawberry volcano?!?! It was super rich and awesome to share with your friends. Filled with brownies; coconut; strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream; drizzled with chocolate syrup; this is not for being who are looking to eat a lite snack. ..I'll definitely come again to try more desserts here! I highly recommend coming here for dessert.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,cDibgUfah5MzaCiofGMIGw,LhdD-269pONbAsEGgIPOzQ,4,Mon petit ami et moi sommes allés à Cacao 70 par accident. Nous avons cherché un restaurant pour le dîner mais comme il était samedi; nous avons eu de difficulté localiser quelque part avec moins d'une heure d'attente. ..Puisque il est de New York; mon petit ami connaît le restaurant Max Brenner qu'il croyait être presque pareille; mais contrairement au restaurant américain; Cacao 70 n'a pas de choix salés pour le dîner. Pour la plupart c'est un restaurant pour le dessert et pour le brunch. ..J'ai voulu les churros mais comme nous n'avions pas encore dîné; nous avons commandé qqch moins chère: la tutti frutti graufe; ce qui était trés petit! La graufe seule n'était rien de spectaculaire; mais la glace à la vanille était de la meilleure glace que j'ai jamais mangé. ..Je veux bien y revenir; mais pas sans manger avant.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,u2TQFNxf70OCk3heWxaa4g,X22gh5Q9xUZs3XXnTPmpuA,1,Sat down to have dessert with my wife today; cheesecake for me and crepe for her. The coffee was decent and the food was OKay. There was one little problem: fruit flies on the coldest day of the winter. That was it. Two or three fruitflies and we complained to the manager who didn't charge us for a partially eaten meal. She did ask my wife to pay for the coffee which we refused. Of course; If you see flies in this weather; it.means there is something wrong with the cleanliness in the kitchen. I also noticed there was an accumulation of furry dust on the walls which is off putting but the place was filled with eager customers. Go figure. Anyways; hygiene should be the utmost factorbin operating an eating establishment. We will never return.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,L3RkqelOGJBRXICDoDDBQQ,pxNCgXZDlmPoGfgAC4CfvA,5,This is how you do business right..Nice place; great food and drink; knowledgable and energetic staff; and consistency..Keep it up guys this is why you are always full.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,FpfOSvyTtaos9m8tB1cO3A,MgKDuquluPvWk76TNSpD7w,5,WHAT A SPOT! If I lived in Montreal I would be here for every meal! Whether you enjoy sweet or savory this place has it all (made exceptionally well at that) The waiters and waitresses are super friendly and make sure everything is perfect. The frittatas come in the skillet and super delicious. Hot chocolate is to die for AND comes with the option for added espresso (what's better than that? IDK!) Definitely check out if you're in the area!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,XK5NeMRDrwqSa9XQIWyskA,AVtbiLe73eO6V3LwbuDAUQ,4,What can i say - its crepes ; chocolate ; caramel & other good stuff. And this place has pizza deserts! WIN
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,44WfnZFh-atRchFz9Xocmg,77zdA9BQCI-64vCAmSyZJg,5,There's not much that could go wrong when chocolate is involved; and this place knows how it's done. Been here multiple time and have never been disappointed. My favourite is definitely the triple chocolate fondue. I recently had their new homemade marshmallow dish with fondue and waffles for 2 which was also mouth watering. If you have never been this is definitely a place you need to go at least once and leave your diet behind you!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,TgmrMPyffco_SHjmntOYtw,NpXkMEM1y5F6t1x5BK5xMA,1,The woman at the counter was absolutely horrible to us. Rude and condescending. Left there after 5 minutes disappointed and insulted.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,4YDE_B5VWhCa8sbkUmEkVg,06og43eU0PiwjwsvCtTzgA,3,Funny thing. I'm not sure if I really like or somewhat dislike this place. The chocoholic in my loves it. The hot dark chocolate is yummy and who wouldn't like a chocolate dessert style pizza?!? That said; I also find the open industrial unfinished rustic look too cold and uninviting for the warmth and coziness that chocolate represents. The menu; which is a tad predictable and unoriginal; could benefit from more creative dishes and I was disappointed by some of dishes on more than one occasion. If ever you have a hankering for a chocolate & oatmeal breakfast; I'd avoid it here. Rather lacks in any taste and the use of milk chocolate instead of dark only adds to the blandness. That said; do try one of the sweet creamy cocoa oozy dessert pizzas. You'll feel like Miss Piggy; but it'll satisfy that sweet tooth for a while!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,ST-IJuGjEU1_Iyh2QdfpeA,YoC_vdt6nZpGiF2ryFBHKQ,5,Le lieu des chocophyles! Tout est là; l'ambiance; l'odeur du chocolat; la qualité; la longue liste de choix.

VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,-C3VwXaekwydiJWAth8Inw,f5ar31EgPJAcfRaOuU60Lg,4,Best breakfast for anyone with a sweet tooth. Had waffles drizzled in dark and white chocolate. It's pretty hard not to overeat at this place!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,E8N-hgXND7_wUGOA5u9jKA,nM5U5lyPJAN4Xel2IS37Qw,4,You can't really complain to much about a place that has the basis of chocolate built into their name. What I love about this place is that you're overwhelmed by the amazing scents of chocolate as soon as you walk. Every dish looks amazing as the servers walk by with them.  It's always busy which is a testament to the food.......almost every menu item has chocolate on it; in  it; under it; over it; through it; etc. etc. They did a great job with the ambiance and the location nice and central. Go there! Have Chocolate!!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,MIJ6XeneTBYa7LiRDlTs8Q,kJX7H9LmqEm4GUS8o1j3iQ,2,Didn't come here for their sweet dishes; so I can't comment on those; but we were disappointed with our experience...We came here for brunch right has they opened up; but service was so incredibly slow. There was only one cashier/server and one chef (who was making both the food and drinks). Several people just got up and left before their food arrived. We would have left too if not for half of our group already getting their food...Likewise; they got one of our orders wrong and we had to return one of the other plates because an ingredient was making her feel sick (one of the ingredients tasted like it had gone bad). They fixed the wrong order and asked to remake the other dish; but we didn't want to wait any longer and left it be.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,9Wd777p9uTHJmvzuCf8c4Q,C7zRHhSfovSt3DwD3O-Rzw,2,We were excited to come here based on the existing reviews; but were disappointed by the desserts and service. The hostess was very unwelcoming and it seemed like she didn't want to work there. There were tables with leftovers from previous visitors; and no one bothered to clean up after them. The desserts were also very mediocre. We had ordered crepes and a cheesecake. The cheesecake was good; but the crepes were cold. .I wouldn't go back when visiting Montreal.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,X-_KbWOstBeSLw6rm9S56Q,FNitiSjCksoYvXwoziu1mw,5,Even though I was difficult tonight Catrina gave my friend and I a patient great service. At first I was kinda disappointed; but I think she over heard our comments and make sure we left happy. Thank you Catrina for the experience. After all we had a great time.

VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,sKD9uyVlGxaJXpWxOP2SUg,es6pJe0RG4NEOntQzgyeHA,5,This place is amazing. The hot chocolates are shareable and the brunch items are too.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,4kULiJwA_LSuXUIRmbLIYg,_qVNpr_Om1eTebNreS4BdQ,5,Pure decadence!  Delicious chocolate.  A cornucopia of selection.  From the healthiest antioxidant packed cocoa to the sweetest desserts; this place has it all.  Huge menu.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,v_93OfVyqq3zOn_-tsRSzA,Iw8-hC6XSZKAeJfodyZPtg,4,This was a great place for brunch. I recommend getting the frittata brunch which comes with a side of fruit and chocolate fondue. There is an expansive chocolate menu but they also have great breakfast items!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,mY3NA8f6H0-i38SOjxyhFg,YVMOmjCCZa8txCoRgR4qRQ,4,Slow service! .Tried there spicy hot chocolate excellent choice. Don't think you can go wrong ...The vanilla and chocolate waffle was excellent; it's can be easily shared with two.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,eiaX_kY6b8NtZmNbXZ1HKA,vkSxIRhbKN3CNkl10gQeOw,4,Ordered triple chocolate fondue. It came with fruits; brownies and waffles pieces. The brownie with chocolate fondue was really chocolatty!! If you are craving for chocolate this is a must! Mini waffles were disappointing; didnt taste like anything. Good place to go with girl friends. Prompt service good location.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,wxRVZowoEoy7kscvU-FX-w,Z5kOEbtBgAlxz0ggnJaGmQ,3,Hubby and I were curious to try this place out; and shared a sweet experience for two. Some were definitely bigger hits (marshmallow chocolate pizza) than others (vanilla ice cream -- but mainly because you're just not interesting enough when your neighbours on the dessert plate are chocolate brownie bites; chocolate wafers; and chocolate sauce) but I liked the variety. ..Contrary to Juliette's (where service is a bit inconsistent -- some days I feel like that place is oozing snootiness); our server here was super helpful; friendly; and what I appreciated the most -- she didn't try to talk us into ordering more food than what we could finish. (We were considering getting the sampler AND a waffle; but she advised us to start with one and to see how we feel because she said it was common that people's eyes were bigger than their stomachs when it came to the restaurant). We took her advice and boy was she right!! We needed to be rolled out the door after that dessert sampler and would never have been able to take a few bites of anything else. ..I feel like 4-stars might be more appropriate for this place but the prices feel a smidge too high. I've only been here once; so I will dutifully go again to see if the service is as awesome as the first time to see about bumping this up to 4!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,YJBuMpsVPMtpqfq00CxrvQ,rFQneGHAxPVf1NXq-yRezw,2,If you are a student and enjoy good company and good looking desserts; come here. Service at the kitchen and around the tables is not so great. Even with good quality products; the chocolate was room temp ( even after requesting to warm it up!) and server did not overlook our table after sitting down. We needed to request napkins twice! Anyways I don't think I'll come back with my wife and young kids again. We went to Juliette & Chocolat at DIX30 two weeks ago and it was far better than this.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,wqpFMPcKo6-8Id-mju3HmA,gbh1Z-jpdOYRfqSFvoEiCg,5,"This restaurant has a very warm and comforting feel when you enter. We were greeted by the hostess as soon as we got in and seated immediately. The menu is very extensive and offer English and French language. We; as a table; ordered 'fire it up crepes; savory waffles ; chicken waffles. For drinks I got there signature mocha in dark chocolate milk and it was very excellent. I ordered my fire it up crepes without cheese but when the order came it had cheese. Our waitress immediately took care of it. Great service; highly recommended!

The specialty here is shish kabob and I would recommend the lamb even though they kebab all types of meat.  The salad that comes with dinner is awesome thanks to the herby Greek dressing they use.  My only complaint was that the baklava was tough to cut through and I need a knife to do it.  Prices are higher than most Greek establishments but the interior is all new and service is prompt.
CXNioV5b1zCS04EcENhdbQ,rM53cdFIvcmakcPl5Ei4kQ,M6FPSlLk29ZKq-wWvEyWvw,1.0,Was so irritated with what just happened at Barros I had to yelp this right away. Waited 45 minutes for our dine in order only to find that it hadn't been made (we had to ask the staff). Asked for a refund. Manager came over and refunded only the pizza and breadsticks that were never made but did not refund our drinks? Whatever happened to making things right? I would have expected a full refund and then a next time you come back (if you do) it's on us type of a thing. So I'm the end my family didn't eat but had to pay $6 for our drinks. Classy."

It came with fruit; brownies; and waffle bites. I enjoyed it a lot and got extra chocolate at the end. The crepe my cousin had was pretty good. The waffle was likewise good but too sweet with their milk chocolate.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,4ayVX0YKY3GSP2IICpLJXQ,if5OQA3gZHy_SXIOAZleQw,4,This was my family's choice for a final brunch in Montreal and although the sweet dessert items were delicious; improvements can be made on their savoury dishes. We ordered a meat lovers omelette; fire up the veggies crepe and a plain waffle. Both brunch dishes were served with fresh fruit and chocolate dip which was a nice mini appetizer before breakfast! The plain waffle is what stood out in this meal. It was fluffy; lightly sweet and buttery. It tasted great even without any toppings and was a great add on! The crepe was a quite flavourless but the eggs were done well and the omlette was huge for a good price. Dishes came very slowly even though it was not very busy that morning...Overall; I would love to try some more of their sweet options but their brunch is nothing to visit for.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,buExMKd4mSaP_9awgqfgHw,WaUUe4XRnjLRr1s3iOEFqw,1,Poor customer service!!!! If you see  a lot of people waiting there; it does not exactly mean that the place is good. It is probably because the waiters don't give a F*** about the customers that come in. After 10 min of waiting to be sited;  we finally got a good spot. BUT after 5 minutes the waiter demanded us ( not asked) to move to another table because he wants to put a group over there of three people ( on table for 2) . I don't know about their food quality but the service is Horrible!! If you want a good service; good food go to Juliette et chocolate it is much better ; and few steps away
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,lUWYNQQX66D_SsdJAlC5jw,jpsz6a9whC2JuKfMOVSI0w,5,God damn addictive!!!! Nuff said .. Lol it's like a diner; their sandwiches are really good and the pizzaaa; sugar overload!!! Never get tired of this
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,KGYVQ5DwN1KEkoZOmVnL5Q,f4bNsUbPGD8RvPSLmz8Fyw,5,Amazing! Great decor and all the food is good. I went here like three times in 4 days.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,jXdnU8ONRIHVzhmDBvlmOQ,lgUV33ykCN1R3OV_PG7lsg,5,First of all the staff in this place are always smiling and welcoming. Service is fairly fast; however in you happen to visit in rush hours you may need to wait a bit. I tried the apple crepe (with extra cinnamon!!) and I loved it. Delicious and healthy I say. The ambience is warm and inviting. I enjoy the woody design.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,-HMryuf0scfllObkYFF0hg,AgiuGyTL342kB6vb99alcQ,5,I visited Cacao 70 again tonight; and was again astonished by the quality/originality of their desserts! .This time; I ordered the triple chocolate pizza; and didn't regret my choice AT ALL. .Scrumptious sweet; indeed. I literally died inside! .My clothes might be slightly tighter tomorrow morning; but every single bite was worth it! :)..This place is a GEM! The ambiance is very laid-back (great music); and the service makes you want to come back to taste some more of their baked goods. Will be back for sure!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,f-uoHlqYm4D5kzAx6-JUbQ,ilGslwxviLHlOcJoZ2lmIQ,5,Wanna get stuffed with chocolate (and/or sugar in general)? This is the place! Just upon entering the sweet chocolate scent hits you in the face. Come early in the afternoon or morning; since it can get pretty busy in the evenings (the place is rather small and craving a sugar hit; you won't want to wait)...The menu is long; actually a bit too long if you ask me. It's very difficult to decide; unless you wanna come every day and try something different. Well; that was not the case here since we were in town only for a little while. If you are a party of at least two or three people; it's worth ordering an assortment of several things - Sweet Chocolate Experience or Sharing for Two or More; that way you get to try more and share instead of getting too stuffed by yourself...We ordered a Triple Chocolate Cake (kinda resembles Tiramisu); something we should have shared; cause it's too much for one person - too much chocolate in one go (if there is such a thing; you'll say... and there is!). Black and White Waffle - a huge portion of waffles; chocolate; ice cream and whipped cream (also a lot for one person); Hot Chocolate and a Strawberry White Chocolate Shake (a small one). A lot (too much) for one evening if you ask me. Everything was tasty; but tolling on our stomachs...Next evening we tried Strawberry and Cheesecake Crepe (the best decision I've made here); Tuna Sandwich with a side salad; Chicken Sandwich without sides and a Brazilian Coffee. Sandwiches were nothing special - too much bread and too little contents (in the end it's a chocolate place; not a sandwich place; sometimes I forget about these things). The crepe was a proper one and I would have ordered it again if ever in town. ..All in all a good dessert place; but try to hold yourself back a bit when ordering. Even if you're super hungry; you might get stuffed all too fast; so rather share and order twice; if needed. :)..Staff is super helpful and they speak English - also the menu comes in English as well.

Pas de lineup; une place calme; pas loin du centre-ville où ça sent le chocolat... très appétissant. Pour ceux qui sont moins fan du sucré; les déjeuners salés sont moins nombreux; mais tout aussi bien. J'adore
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,T-_Je1gqrGo5PJfCXpK4PQ,N6x1fawtLGGFExo4kAMPRQ,5,In need of Saturday brunch our hotel's concierge recommended this place. It was amazing. The restaurant is really cute and has an upbeat fun cafe vibe. It smells like chocolate as soon as you open the door. The menu has tons of options so everyone is bound to find something they would like. We both got frittatas which came served in a cast iron pan. They were perfect. To our surprise the frittatas came with fresh fruit and melted chocolate for dipping. I'm not a big chocolate fan but I have to say the chocolate was really delicious. The service was great. I would love to visit Cacao 70 again when returning to Montreal in the future.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,J9lhDNOKoioV_qXeZvUpeA,5h6-X4Qnqfhwiw28O-68ag,3,J'ai testé la version salée donc je reviendrai pour une douceur au chocolat plus tard. J'ai pris une Savoury waffle qui était bonne. L'endroit était désert et pas très chaleureux.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,fgMm10gARSTZi9JB_UVHiA,oqZkrPWBBO4SoabmBzNIsw,4,Walking back to our place after a show at the Comedy Nest; I nearly stopped in my tracks when I saw this cute restaurant. A snap decision to get dessert is always a good idea! The menu is extensive and it's hard to choose what chocolate creation to get; but we finally decided on the triple chocolate fondue. Consistency was velvet smooth; artfully swirled with the perfect amount of dipping accompaniments. Wish this place was in the states!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,06ileEKtKsGrY_MDzdxt6Q,Ngzi7iG5q4x3WYBOjRF5Bw,4,the waiting time is long but the food is always amazing; my all time favorite the marshmallow bbq and choc crepe; it has become a traditional between me and my friend to always take our dessert at cacao 70 after our meal on st-catherine; i always bring my visting friends there; its a must in Montreal !
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,1eyYseHJ0mIhAWt_vpvPqg,5,Well...looks like Juliette et Chocolat has a competitor now..although the charm of J&C  is still my fave; the quality of this place might slightly surpass J&C...Cacao 70; for those of you who don't know; is a newish chocolate place nestled between du Fort and Chomedy on St Catherines. It's a cute little place with a MASSIVE list of chocolate options ranging from drinks to crepes to ice creams to cakes and even to chocolate pizzas! I've been a handful of times; and each time I push myself to try something new. Happily; I'm never disappointed! It's a little on the pricey side (at ~9 for a hot chocolate); but totally worth it! ..Go try it out - I promise you won't be disappointed!..Oh and; they even have savory snacks (amazing sandwiches!)
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,FkqSnHBcSKtYPujiP8KXFg,4,I had the Illegal chocolate waffle - Classic waffle drizzled with a 36% caramel chocolate sauce; milk chocolate shavings; served with caramelized bananas; crunchy chocolate wafer balls; chocolate sauce on the side and whipped cream. Now if that picture (shown in original post on my blog) above doesn't look like some sordid orgy of everything you know of breakfast; brunch; chocolate; and sin to be true and what you'd think the last room service order to Britney Spears' hotel room looks like before she shaved her head... then I don't know what does.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,E2oq_BwdQmq_Vyte65icNg,8xRKuOECK8A_Cm7ZqY2y7Q,3,A place completely dedicated to chocolate; ahhhhh!! I was so eager to go; I took a good 30 minutes at home to check out the online menu beforehand. After much deliberation; I picked a chocolate pizza; and decided then and there; that that would be it. If you don't make your mind up pretty quick; be warned; you might fall into a stupor! Will you have a...waffle? a...brownie?a...sundae? The options are mind-blowing; but if you happen to be with friends; a sure bet would be their plates for two; so you can sample everything. .We were seated very quickly; and as so many other reviewers have mentioned; the space is lovely; if a little cramped. I guess what they lack in space; they make up in portion size! My chocolate-ricotta pizza arrived on some sort of marble counter-top; which was odd; and incredibly heavy. Sorta tough to maneuver when eating. The pizza was good; and had a nice balance of salty and sweet. The waffles are beautiful; but I'm not sure the spongy texture is my thing. The mini-brownies on the other hand are great! The highlight of the meal was the raspberry-chocolate sundae. That thing is pure decadence. It's massive; it has brownie chunks in it. Gah! Would totally recommend!.I wasn't crazy about the service though. My biggest gripe about the place is actually the chocolate. Sad face. It's very sweet and I wonder if they don't prefer the use of candy-level chocolate as opposed to the purer stuff..
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,mM5phAV3wjCXfYw0LUmcng,THCAa0vAB2qRTXUSm4WAoA,5,This is by far the best dessert place I have been to in Montreal. My husband took me here and I absolutely fell in love with this place. For all those dessert lovers and bookworms- this place is nirvana. They have amazing milkshakes; crepes and waffles. My personal favourite is the Strawberry Cheesecake crepe. I took my family there as well when they came visiting and they loved it too. ..I'm waiting for more out of town family members to come so I can take them here. It's a heavy on the pocket and I would advice everyone to reach atleast an hour before they close to get good service but overall it should be on everyone's 'things to do in Montreal' list.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,ZXDlYFftPh4bQHKDT9tueg,4,It's like Charlie going to the Chocolate Factory!  Yummy chocolate is oozing from practically everything!  Our waitress; Amy; is the awesomest!!!  Had the waffle--portion is just right.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,M_WL8dyH52QxDdGbFIpFPA,GcJz2se61Lmr4ZNdsBQvnw,4,Walked in around 4PM on a weekend. The place was pretty packed but we were able to find a seat right away as we were a small group. Friend got the waffle and i went for the fondue. Both were good with really nice presentation; however unless you've got a serious sweet tooth this wouldn't be something i recommend. Both our totals came around under $20 tips included. Our server was super nice; helpful; and attentive. ..Reasons this place isn't 5 stars. .1. We asked one of the other servers for assistance since ours was halfway across the room; and we were kinda blown off. .2. It's pricey. I know i know pretty much all trendy places are pricey and this place was no exception; but still $14 for a waffle?! (Price is an estimation. I don't recall specifically) ..Anyways if you're fond of sweet things (and i mean SERIOUSLY fond; i couldn't even finish my fondue and i have 7 fillings from my sweet eating habits); this is a cute place to stop for a nibble.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,wregZkyJ3efquMrnrgqGQw,Ii9X7_Aore6DKaQWaFRENA,2,The good news: The sandwich bread is delicious. The chocolate quality is; indeed;1st rate. .The bad news: They got 1 of our 2 orders wrong and an order at the table next to ours. My chicken salad was so full of mustard flavour that I could barely finish it though I was famished and too much of the mesclun was rusted. Yet; when my friend asked for mustard for her supposed beef crepe she was told they had none. To boot the crepe had a super thin single layer of beef and almost none of the advertised mushrooms or cheese besides being too sweet to be called savoury. Our mugs of hot chocolate were so huge that we could not have finished them in a million years and the orange flavour advertised was no where to be seen. Service was impossibly slow but they appear to be understaffed and what staff there is appeared under-trained. .Verdict: The bad outweighed the good too much for me to go back. There's better elsewhere.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,HBGPBZoQ3rS-mUUWaW6Ruw,XJAk1FjN17O-XOY8atPOTw,4,This place was a great alternative to my normal Montreal chocolate-centric restaurant which is Juliette et Chocolat. I honestly over did it on the chocolate here but every bit of it was worth it...My meal consisted of a waffle (very sweet; though i wish it wasn't candyish flavored) topped with vanilla ice cream; whipped cream and chocolate fudge drizzle and white chocolate drizzle.  This included a side of warm milk and white chocolate to dip my ice cream of waffle in; if the drizzle was not enough; with an additional few grams of  milk chocolate ball toppings (I'm sure that there's some much more eloquent name for them).  The meal was very rich to say the least.  I OD'd on sugar and chocolate.  I only wish that the waffle wasn't ridiculously sweet and that one of the female waitresses wasn't  so non-attentive and nonchalant.  Overall good experience for a busy late evening snack though.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,ekYLOxLqOd_-eRDSBfz_4Q,4,Giant sticky menus; refrigerated counters of chocolates; a happy crowd of people laughing and quite possibly eating chocolate marshmallow pizza for dinner without judgement because why the hell not; super friendly chill service; in general it's hard to not be a fan of this place when you're in the right mood for it. I went with my family after a dinner in the area; there was no line when we arrived and we laughed and were dazzled by the indulgent menu but ended up sharing two ice cream parfaits; one with this delicious caramelized coconut topping and both with brownies; and it was good times.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,h31k2DwP2K4SPuxiS7u6Yg,XTO5b9T3AEszrsFJMlXJWw,5,This is one of the best crepe places I've been to. The cappuccino is absolutely perfect. Not too strong not too weak. Creamy and smooth. Their crepes are always well cooked. Their service is great always quick. The staff is super nice and friendly.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,PxJnjRuJrBmaDqKE-R-fMQ,O8eueZ6BaX8evSBtq9qfMQ,4,The entrees here are just average; what really makes Cacao 70 great are the numerous desserts and hot chocolate offerings. I definitely recommend trying one of the milk or dark chocolate fondue options- they include a little bit of everything (waffles; fruit; marshmallows; chocolate fondue and a mini hot chocolate cup). Be sure to ask for the hot chocolate menu which includes dozens of different hot chocolates. This restaurant is a bit pricy; but definitely worth trying-especially if you have a major sweet tooth!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,qeW6TWoymrNCoDteDmuI2g,t_J7QE3JO1RmEHvDA-4T_A,5,On my last last adventure I visited the lovely city of Montreal...I saw this restaurant  and had to try it. Oh my Goodness this place was Sooooooo Good! I went back two days in a row...The first day I had the veggie frittata and to my excitement it came with a tray of fresh fruit w/chocolate dipping sauce!..The second day I had the raspberry chocolate crepe with a bowl espresso and milk Mmmmm delicious!..If I had more time in that wonderful city I would have gone there everyday to experience a different plate of chocolate and food.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,DntLZGoUXxMOMHgN0u3CUg,-nEMj_MjIdxGe9AoavrCMQ,5,Amazing! Melt a marshmallow on a fire that reminds you of a camp fire or have the fondue. Must go here if you love chocolate!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,6MM9Yqn7UBM8tmpSHQHAAg,J0UcT2_y_wzxi7wh4TsygQ,3,Oh chocolat! J'aimerais tellement ça que le chocolat ait sa propre catégorie dans le guide alimentaire et qu'on me recommande d'en manger 3 à 4 fois par jour! Avec un charmant café comme Cacao 70; je pourrais même changer de sorte de chocolat des centaines de fois avant de reprendre la même chose! Suis-je la seule à rêver comme ça?..Je suis allée au Cacao 70 à la suite d'une grande marche au froid dans le Parc Mont-Royal avec Laura D qui avait écrit un avis qui me faisait saliver à en lire ses mots. C'est le stop parfait pour un des meilleurs chocolats chauds de votre vie pendant les journées froides d'hiver. La motivation parfaite pour prendre de l'air en plein janvier! J'y ai aussi pris une gaufre nature que j'ai eu le plaisir de tremper dans mon chocolat...Ma seule critique était que parce qu'ils avaient 3 grands groupe vu que c'était en pleine heure du brunch; ils n'était pas bien coordonner pour nous emmener nos choses et le service était lent. 15 minutes pour passer notre commande; 15 minutes pour le chocolat chaud puis au moins 30 minutes si pas plus avant qu'on leur demande si nos plats viendraient. Et pour la facture; c'était un peu la même chose aussi. J'y retournerai donc; mais probablement à un autre moment comme en après-midi ou en pleine semaine.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,dEDId4Rp2JpblIfYIoH00w,u-IUfoz4q2VgPAkktCyXdg,4,My boyfriend and I visited my cousin in Montreal three weeks ago. We got to try a popular chocolate dessert cafe/restaurant called Cacao 70. They offered a limited selection of coffee drinks but I wasn't there for the coffee. Since it was brunch time; I was desperate to have some content into my stomach. I didn't want to order dessert because I had nothing in the morning and didn't want to be filled up on sugar. So I ordered one of their savoury crepes; The House Special (I think; I'm basing it off their online menu since I forgot to record it). It came with fruit appetizers that you could dip in chocolate before the main entree came. I definitely enjoyed the food! It was not crazily mind-blowing and unique; but it definitely gave me a fill and I was definitely content...I really liked the atmosphere and their chocolate-themed restaurant. You could also buy chocolate to take back with you if you wish. I didn't buy any only because they were a bit pricey for a bag...If I was to come back to Montreal (which I obviously am); I would definitely try their dessert crepes. Even if you hate chocolate (like my boyfriend); there is definitely something there for everyone.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,B1VeYJTxrF15aCAtASjixA,0JufC_JIONUKM46ji33j5g,3,Ordered the American hot chocolate; semi-sweet and it was very creamy and tasty.  Very nice to have a real hot chocolate somewhere; especially in cold canada!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,WdRJAIUZ8kcdYjq4krUyoA,tKCkjW9RKZxdZhe6dB5xmQ,4,Went there for brunch with friend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the menu choices and am looking forward to going back. The service was great & friendly.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,qiz6NunKWbZq4m4z4-2ZAg,4,Beware of the relatively big portions in this cacao heaven. The brunch omelettes have a side fruit dish with chocolate to dip in. Both omelettes and crepes are so well sized; by the time your cacao arrives you are already full. If you are cacao lover just focus on it as it is so good and is a meal by itself. BTW you can take your cacao home if you can't finish it. One thing for sure; chocolate beer; import from UK doesn't help either; but tasting a version of chocolate Guinness with your crepe seems to be appropriate although strange combination.  .Service in this place is nice; on a crowded Sunday afternoon we were taken care of promptly. The only problem I had is all my cloths smelled deep fried after I left the resto.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,cfBZdumy0jx3hYgKst3w4Q,TN4ORRtwxeIQooA5bRfZbQ,4,If you're looking for a diabetic coma to fall in to; you have come to the right place! The smell of chocolate permeates the air of this crowded cafe. They somehow have managed to cram a large number of tables into their square footage while maintaining the navigability of the space.  With a menu so overwhelmingly large; it's a good thing the the staff is friendly and helpful and can help you navigate the sea of sweet that comprises their offerings. ..In addition to chocolate and sweets; they also have a selection of savory menu items; such as crepes and paninis. I ordered the breakfast crepe with spinach; feta; and egg. The spinach they used was fresh baby spinach and I was surprise to see the egg did not come inside my crepe but in the format of two perfect sunny side up eggs next to my crepe. As it turned out; I loved it that way! I got to dip my crepe into the runny egg yokes as one would points of toast. My only complaint was that Cacao 70 does not offer be channel sauce with their crepes; and so; the crepe was a bit dry...All in all; a great place to go as long as you don't mind leaving with a bit of a sweets induced tummy ache!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,Dpe2rYGdR2TAI_at_Bw2ew,kIjQdIzPUzBN6lCRLSu_lw,5,I had the nutella raspberry crepe and it was one of the best thin crepes i ever had; in terms of texture and taste! The staff is extremely friendly. The atmosphere is so cute ( perfect to bring ur date guys!). I went with my girlfriends and we absolutely loved it! ..++ very affordable for the quality AND quantity served!!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,vXF6ar6-h4xfzfF2ZoCNMA,6TefyvjOLhB_RrRz5ywoWQ,4,The classic chocolate fondue is really good; the fruits are fresh and the chocolate itself is very good (milk chocolate)
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,IfkB6duL_j1Citzd4R-XBw,3,it should be a 3.5. but soooo much better than juliette and chocolat. .Fondue: gives you the option of one; two or three chocolates for the same price. The fondues are served with seasonal fruits; brownie and waffle bites. The portioni s large enough to share with two..the sharing sharing is a large portion that in my opinion can be shared with three people. Same at the fondue but is served with more stuff like a half nutella pizza. The pizzas are not good. The dough to topping ratio is not proportional and the dough is very dry making it hard to swallow. .The caramelized banana waffle is very good. It's simple. waffle; with caramelized bananas and chocolate drizzled on top. The surgar on top of the bananas are torched making it chewy and adding a different texture to the plate. Satisfies a waffle craving for sure..The hot chocolate is not good; its too thick for it to be a hot chocolate and too watery for it to be a ganache and flavor is off. .A very good date place and dessert for friends and lovers. I would recommend it
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,wAapkfuOdtIMajbFotOY5Q,mI_r14ufUOeqHwJh_36Wug,4,Just love this place! Great decorum; good service; and very large menu. Beware of the chocolate coma that follows
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,Pfn9tdU1snBVkpKxDy1Odw,i8X2JAFGVw-_rMctLfFQFA,5,A great place for satisfying that sweet tooth. Simple decor that's cozy and warm makes you feel welcomed. I regularly go on the weekend for their lunch menu waffles. My favorite is the Illegal Chocolate waffles with banana slices and scrumptious melted chocolate all over it. Service can be a bit slow when they are busy so I tend to avoid the peak hours. They also have an extensive assortment for cocoa connoisseurs but I've only tried a few of them - too much chocolate for lunch!
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,mmcap_lRe2oB2lip-UgDwA,zHiKFR08TP11ZVVzYkj1qQ,1,One star for terrible service...We came here for a late brunch on our last day in Montreal. No complaints about the food. I liked the fresh fruit and melted chocolate that comes with the brunch platters. Nice balance to the savoury sandwich I had. I had the open faced chicken and egg sandwich which was quite good. Chocolate pizza was pretty good as far as the chocolate goes but the dough was a bit thick and overwhelmed the chocolate...We were seated at a tiny table which would have been fine if we were drinking two mugs of hot chocolate. However; the plates for brunch platters and the chocolate pizza are enormous. You can really only fit 1 plate comfortably and 2 if you really squeeze. Our server brought out the fresh fruit and melted chocolate part of the brunch platter first. Within 5 minutes; before I had finished the fruit; they brought out NOT the rest of the brunch (i.e. sandwich and omelette) but the chocolate pizza. We thought it odd to serve the sweet stuff first before brunch but ok; whatever. We worked on the chocolate pizza. AGAIN; in less than 5 minutes; the server showed up to announce that the brunch entrees were out but that they would wait until the table gets cleared up a bit more after we finish the pizza. Clearly our food was getting cold at the pass while we tried to eat the pizza as fast as we can. Before we could finish the pizza; the server just came out with the brunch plates and put them down on the table anyway despite just announcing earlier that he would wait. At this point; the plates were spilling over the edges of our tiny table and we are literally contorting ourselves trying to eat. The napkins had nowhere to go and our server just tossed them on top of the FOOD and rushed away. Needless to say we were completely flabbergasted by this terrible treatment that was completely non-sensical. Even when we had finished the pizza; our server ignored our table and did not take away the stone so that we could have more room with our plates...Would never go back.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,TxtVKk_9Ga6YVc3EPIVSHQ,N3fxYQZu1GYfghNFC-xdsQ,2,Crowded place; I went with friends on sunday afternoon. The chocolate is good bu a bit pricey..Now the service is TERRIBLE! We were 3 friends and got a table (after the looong line). Then 15min later a 4th friend shows up at our table and the waitress refuses to serve him. Apparently it is against their policy to serve 4 people on a small table. We told the waitress we could accommodate; the boss came and told us that we would have to go back to the line up. Again. How retarded.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,PPXfrBJCQkc2KfrP5e6o5w,c7sd05RAyndShVpN80KmHA,5,As a chocolate connoisseur; Cacao70 has made it into my top 5 places to go for a delicious and dangerous (in a good way) chocolaty treat. I'm not usually one to be out done by a dessert but that almost happened the night I wondered in here look for a sweet treat. ..I ordered the quadruple chocolate parfait which consists of chocolate ice cream; chocolate brownie bites; melted chocolate; chocolate whipped cream and chocolate sauce. It looked small compared to my companion's chocolate waffle topped with ice cream; but it packed a major punch. Every bite was just amazing. ..The restaurant it self was a nice size with a cafe vibe.  There's a display of different types of chocolates that you can buy by weight. They also have chocolate artisan candies on sale. I bought a small assortment for a friend and she loved them. This place is nice for small groups and kids. I'd recommend it as a cute place for a date night.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,SQIfkwKkwH_iD-urr0Fiew,hP3bMy3enOM7xpJ0zjf8og,5,This was my favorite meal in Montreal. I want to come back here a million times; alas...It was 10am and we wanted a french-canadian breakfast so where better to go than a crepe place? And Cacao 70 was even better than a crepe place; it was a CHOCOLATE place that serves crepes! ..Boy; everything we ate here was amazing!! Ordered the country ham; cheese and egg crepe which came with a small plate of six whole pieces of fruit with an AMAZING dipping chocolate sauce. The crepe itself was fantastic and literally bigger than my head; huge huge huge tasty crepe!!! We also got the nutella strawberry crepe with ice cream on the side which was even better (naturally; because of the nutella and chocolate aspect); even the ice cream was stand out. Not to mention the stand out cafe au lait and mocha ordered... mmmmmmmmmmmmHM perfection...All in all; favorite place ever. Need to come back to Montreal to eat here again.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,6RVbmq6q5TbhCvr9-4onHQ,5T68sNCWq6F-rUl2UNOmSg,4,Updated with our second Visit (4 days later - Read First Visit below if you haven't done so already)..Second Visit..This visit we ordered a whole bunch of things:.- Raspberry Brownie Parfait (again; but the first time was better as it came with chocolate cream).- Quadruple Chocolate Parfait.- Triple Chocolate Pizza.- Chocolate Nutella Ricotta Pizza.- Chocolate Peanut Butter Pizza.- Waffle with Ice Cream; Fruits and Chocolate.- Raspberry Crepes with Chocolate..Yes; it was insane. The Pizzas were good but we ordered way too many and after a while you can only take so much. One slice per person is enough and I suggest getting something that isn't ONLY chocolate otherwise you go crazy (i.e. Quadruple Chocolate Parfait was good but near the end...). The waffle didn't taste like a waffle; it tasted like a sponge cake that was put into a waffle machine and I actually liked it better this way. As for crepes; it was good but a bit too soggy (too much jam on whatever the liquid was) for my taste. There are pics on my blog!..First Visit..After our visit to Kazu; which if you read about can tell that I was still super hungry (Satya actually cooked up a supper when we came back right after going to Kazu and Cacao 70!) we decided to try out the now chocolate place; Cacao70. I think it was a Presse Café before and the transformation into a chocolate bar was a good one. The place is aesthetically pleasing; well lit and makes you crave chocolate in every way. I am a huge chocolate lover and used to pound down tons of chocolate as a kid...We started off with some samples of hot chocolate. Despite the varying degrees of sweetness; I must say that the texture and taste of all the types were amazing...The Raspberry brownie parfait was great. The whipped cream was chocolatey and the ice cream went down really well with the brownies and raspberries. The triple chocolate cake was ok but the cake seemed to be more of a marble pound cake than a chocolate one. I haven't tried the chocolate pizza yet but it seems to look yummy. Maybe the next time I go.
VqT-IURXmVS_fVRLTKxTFQ,w7Lr5GQOAa4XhoYm18yWHA,b7D6QDZ5-kPD1wrOo34cQw,5,Been there with friends for breakfast. Love the food very much! I personally like their the sweet more than savoury.
w8fIvdOCIRpS05fYhTPO0w,LUHwtIgfclx_9PKfJJQ1YA,3kxwveEv9kn22pOs6P51OA,4,This is my first time going to Yeh; as my daughters took me there...The good: Very good ice cream. Various different flavours. Lots of choices of toppings. Nice seatings and enough for everyone (we were there during the day). Nice staff; they were available to answer our questions...The bad: Ice cream machines could be a little cleaner in the drop zone. Cups section could have been filled and looks less like half-empty. Can end up being expensive (sold by weight)...This is a very nice place to have a good ice cream; if you can pay for it.
w8fIvdOCIRpS05fYhTPO0w,C4gv2YfW6GqePWBBapph8A,7YYTi0eic9igGSuDgulFTA,4,$$$ Great tasting food the way you want it...Had combo swirl of green apple and berry frozen yogurt and it was a perfect cold dessert. Here; you can serve yourself from a wide selection of toppings. And the crepe was made to order and deliciously wrapped (prefer wrapped). Friendly and patience service. A little pricey but worth it for the occasional indulgence.
w8fIvdOCIRpS05fYhTPO0w,fzdGX9PVFeO-BaNEw0VtIg,j-KC52_k-oJnRDsOMrqrAQ,3,It is a nice place; the ambiance is really relax. The ice cream flavors a pretty great and the topping also but the price by weight is simply overpriced and this is the reason it is 3/5
WEQz73SfsAPNLdWjJTKU7w,CfuRf-DIM5hh-HrFKpewaQ,RRkPJe4wq3cpVIM1Zjnlzg,1,The guy messed up my order. Asked for the Asian Fusion salad bowl to go. My bowl missed the kimchi and there were no beets. Plus; something in the salad smelled off; like it had gone bad. Maybe it was the tomato salsa thing. It was meh. Wouldn't come back to this location again
WEQz73SfsAPNLdWjJTKU7w,oSXIHISg8qRXx1X6nn4cUA,VvL288JYZrbZ_t9JShN1qQ,3,So this place is basically like a vegan fast food joint! Walk-in; place an order; pay upfront; pick it up when it's ready and take it to your table! Not that there's anything wrong with that; but I just wasn't expecting it.. .A few of us had a bunch of different things; and everything was overall pretty good. Nothing was really over the top or even worth trying again. I had to Copper Burger... which came with a pretty yummy dijon maple vegenaise sauce. I did try someone else's poutine... baked potatoes with a portobello gravy and vegan cheese. But not so good at all and really nothing close to a vegan poutine. (I love portobellos and I love poutine; but this just didn't work.).The Bombay soup was good but pretty mild in flavors. The shitake teriyaki spelt wrap was tasty but the coleslaw was a little too overpowering. The bowls do seem pretty interesting though; but I didn't get to try any of them; so maybe next time...As for dessert; the Raspberry Chia pudding was pretty fun but the Cashew Cranberry Lime Dream cheesecake on the other hand was really delicious!!!! (Of course it was; since it was made by Rawesome)
WEQz73SfsAPNLdWjJTKU7w,9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,eOSgmlTpHeXMrIzVpyM-3g,1,I just ate here with a few friends. 2 of us ordered fries and the Copper burger. The fries were OBVIOUSLY precooked and heated. They tasted as if they were at least a day old and were starchy and inedible. Their ketchup tasted like barbque sauce!..The presentation of the veggie burgers was sloppy and the burgers were cold on the inside!..Neither of us received our reciepts so we had to pay for parking as we didn't get our parking validated :(..Also; the wait time was 15 minutes!! The workers didn't seemed stressed due to the rush and were moving very slowly and in the end what you get is worse than something a teenager would have made but these guys were grown adults!..The smoothie was OK but it's not fresh fruit it's just high sugar ingredients. The seating next to the restaurant was full of dawson kids eating McDonalds so we had to eat upstairs (also crowded with students)..PASS.

The picture of my breakfast; on their board; Avocado toast attracted me.. So I ordered the toast with mango and orange juice. The service was nice with a smile. My avocado toast was amazing. It had tomato with tiny beans. I felt good. It hit right spot in my tummy.

wqsZzIM79Q--QP_lSRcPyg,EPsWdQzalccFouFC4NDVeA,e4MfKckKkQSMwkldBo-lZw,4,J'adore y aller. L'ambiance est chouette et une superbe terrasse l'été. Il y a des sièges pour bébé sur place. Un peu cher (30$ pour un bol régulier Aztec avec un assiette pour enfant et un kumbucha). Révélation pour le shiitake tériaki et les fausses ailes tériaki aussi! Le hic; pas de table à langer sur place!
wqsZzIM79Q--QP_lSRcPyg,-B2NxZerjNSMfPiHDXrqHA,NzJ6lVzv3DZDGthPrzP84g,4,Bel endroit ensoleillé pour s'installer étudier; les plats sont colorés et végétaliens (enfin; on n'a pas à se casse la tête pour trouver une option végé!) J'ai essayé le bol général Cooper; c'est épicé et j'ai bien aimé! Les cafés sont abordables. Enfin un endroit qui ne surchage pas la totale pour une alternative vegan!..Le service est sympathique; mais je confirme les autres avis; ils ne semblent pas comprendre très bien le français. Quand j'ai dit que c'était ma première fois et que j'avais entendu parler du poulet fait de shitake on m'en a donné un échantillon pour goûter. Ils m'ont conseillé un minimum et donc ont gagné un point pour le côté sympathique; ils essaient ;)

Que cela soit mon burger shitake ou le burger à la patate douce. Les frites au four changent des classiques frites à l'huile..Cons :.- Cher; pour 29 dollars on a eu le droit à 2 burgers et une grosse frite. Aucune boisson ni dessert.- Trop de déchet; on n'est pas capable de servir des smoothies dans un verre en verre; seulement du plastique. Idem pour les desserts qui sont dans des emballages en plastique; quel intérêt lorsque l'on mange sur place à part générer des déchets inutilement ?.- Le coté trop fast food des lieux..Je n'adhère pas à leur modèle et je trouve des incohérences dans leur fonctionnement;.Je ne reviendrais pas renouveler l'expérience
wqsZzIM79Q--QP_lSRcPyg,6tpaaz8cZwgPW2MNlWeo_Q,dkw1r2XZb-FLnZuheQApmw,1,Lorsque j'ai commandé (en spécifiant que j'allais être assise sur la terrasse à l'extérieur); on m'a dit que ça prendrait 10 minutes (déjà je trouvais le délais plutôt long pour du riz et des brocolis; mais je me suis dit que si ça en valait la peine; j'allais attendre dehors patiemment). J'ai demandé à la caissière s'ils allaient venir porter mon bol sur la terrasse lorsque ce serait prêt; mais elle m'a dit qu'il fallait que je revienne moi-même dans 10 minutes pour le recevoir. D'accord. J'ai alors regardé l'heure et je suis sortie à l'extérieur. 8 minutes plus tard; je suis entrée afin d'être prête lorsqu'ils serviraient mon bol (j'ai alors perdu ma place dehors puisque j'étais seule et que quelqu'un s'y est assis quand je suis entrée). Mon bol n'était pas prêt. D'autres clients arrivés après moi étaient maintenant servis.. Je suis donc ressortie quelques minutes et lorsque j'ai vu de l'extérieur qu'il y avait un bol sur le comptoir; j'ai cru que c'était le mien; alors je suis entrée le chercher. Mais ce n'était lui.. J'ai demandé au préparateur où en était ma commande et il m'a dit qu'elle n'existait plus! Il a parlé à la caissière en disant qu'il l'avait remis à une autre cliente arrivée après moi!! Pas la peine de spécifier qu'ils demandent nos noms lorsqu'on commande en plus... La caissière m'a ainsi dit que ça allait reprendre un autre 10 minutes pour m'en préparer un nouveau! Lorsque j'ai dit non; que je voulais être remboursée à la place; elle m'a dit que finalement; ça allait prendre seulement 2 minutes..! Mais pourquoi m'ont-ils fait attendre 10 minutes la première fois alors?! Enfin; ça aurait pu passer; mais la caissière n'était pas capable de me rembourser en argent par elle-même; alors elle a demandé à l'autre fille derrière (ça devait être la gérante) qui m'a engueulée pour me dire que c'était ma faute si je n'avais pas reçu mon bol parce qu'ils avaient dit mon nom; mais que comme je ne venais pas (j'étais DEHORS alors je ne pouvais pas entendre!!); tant pis pour moi; j'ai perdu mon bol!! J'ai alors dû lui répondre d'assumer son erreur et de ne pas me mettre sa responsabilité sur le dos alors que j'attendais longuement seule sur la terrasse et que je devais en plus me déplacer moi-même pour venir le chercher! Elle ne m'a pas remis tout le montant au complet lors de la remise et elle avait une attitude arrogante alors qu'elle aurait dû s'excuser d'avoir remis mon bol à une autre et de mon aussi longue attente! Enfin; alors qu'elle m'a souhaité une bonne soirée sur un ton très ironique; je ne peux que lui souhaiter la meilleure des faillites!
wqsZzIM79Q--QP_lSRcPyg,QYC3HlU2lVeocJSU_UP73A,jnQmS-4idoAyI5e1nlL8rw,3,The bean burger is really good. Though I have to say that if  you order from it with foodora you might be pretty disappointed. We ordered two vegan poutine once and it got with almost no cheese and no sauce. They were nice enough when we call to give us two more although we had to go get it ourselves. I guess; like any chain restaurant; the service can vary from place to place but they still need to have some standards about the food.
wqsZzIM79Q--QP_lSRcPyg,6FACGvOCODfRjiItq0NEIQ,I3G52ED2Xfgk4sNGlhFY4A,5,I visited Montreal for a weekend and I literally grabbed breakfast here every single day. I was vegan at the time so it was difficult to come across a vegan breakfast spot but we found this gem! It was so delicious and the staff was VERY friendly. The ambiance is awesome and the decor is one of a kind. I will definitely visit here again on my next trip to Montreal!

wqsZzIM79Q--QP_lSRcPyg,RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,GkN7qhf_-pE7OSVaWuESMw,4,I decided to try out the Copper Branch location on Mont Royal Avenue for lunch one day as I was looking for a place near work that will serve me a hearty salad for lunch and not the lettuce-tomato based options most take out places offer. ..I ordered one of the power bowls for lunch; you choose a base from brown rice; quinoa; konjac noodles or mixed lettuce; and then a protein from tempeh; tofu cubes; tofu scramble; shiitake teriyaki; or carrot keftedes. i went for the asian Fusion bowl with edamame; kimchi; beets; carrot; broccoli; sprouted mung beans; spiced chickpeas; goji berries; and black sesame seeds over a mixed lettuce base; with shitake mushrooms for protein; and the tamari ginger dressing. Ouf that was as much as a mouthful to say as it was to eat! The regular portion was more than filling and I thoroughly enjoyed the flavors and mix of textures in the salad.  The ingredients were fresh; well prepared but I found the salad a little heavy with all those beans and not enough greens considering I only had at most half a cup of lettuce. ..The venue itself was clean and well maintained; nothing fancy but it is a chain after all! The service was friendly and personalized; which much like Starbucks; they call you up by name to pick up your order...Overall; i enjoyed my visit. I would be curious to try their other combinations. However; I would prefer a little more lettuce in my power bowl next time...
wqsZzIM79Q--QP_lSRcPyg,RrueaTJ6SUHgmD5imVqp7w,2nL2MA2sZWgicdzH7qLKnA,4,Cooper branch is great for what it is healthy fast food. Not the most sensational or exciting food- but fast; fresh and won't leave you feeling weighed down. I avoid all the sauces with sugar in the so I can't speak to items with sauce.  Great when in a rush or pinch and want a full meal to eat quickly.
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,nZUsDCm1v1tSJVWJHFEflg,wrl6UQLLpObE8q-oS9Akww,4,I went on a Sunday night with my family for my birthday (because Indian food gives me life) and b o y was it crowded. Especially because we were a group of 4; we had to wait for around 20-30 minutes. I recommend reserving a seat or going on a non-peak timing; when I last went there on lunchtime on a weekday; so I got to enjoy all the good food without the wait at all. ..The food here is always really good; I had the palek paneer and the vegetarian thali the last time; which was awesome (the palek paneer was one of the best ones in Montreal in my humble opinion) but I got out of my comfort zone and ordered different dishes this time. As the appetizer; we got a pani puri; which was so nostalgic since I used to have it in Malaysia. However; they don't have enough of the potatoes for the filling; which was kind of sad. It wasn't as spicy as I hoped for it to be as well. It was still really good though. We got a tikka paneer masala; chana masala; and chicken curry (for my non-vegetarian family) for the entrees. The tikka paneer masala was phenomenal; I dream of it till today. It's the perfect combination of sweet and salty for me and it satisfied my Indian food craving instantly. The chana masala wasn't too special for me; especially after the tikka paneer masala. My family liked their curry chicken too. The price was quite reasonable too; I believe it was less than $60 and it fed my family very well...The service is quick and friendly; which is impressive since it was such a busy time. I also thought it was really smart that they had this carpets that would guide the waiters and waitresses when they bring stuff to the tables. You'll know what I mean when you see it...The ambience is a mix of casual and cozy; especially with the people talking not too loudly. Overall; I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to Indian food lovers. It's family-friendly; BYOW; and has awesome food! (Bring your own wine opener though!)
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,frlKbObavggbdI6cWYO8XA,5DUPQrzCetfzP_a462y_Fw,4,Punjab is another good Indian in the neighborhood. I always take to go but it's a bring your own wine. I don't like too much the look of that restaurant. The only reason why I pick this place sometimes is for their Kormas. You won't regret!
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,emZr_JJQeFBHL5173ORF_A,bYMiJ-zNTl-1208cIRnV1w,4,My sister's favourite Indian restaurant in Montreal (she lived in India so she knows her stuff)..Service is ok; food is great; very close to métro Acadie in case you don't have a car.
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,7Ri5xkuj6rMvD8F2zjWFow,b5ztPqUOHjxa38__-e32EA,4,The waiter was really polite; and the service was fast and efficient. The place seemed not very well lit and a little too dark for me; and their washrooms are smaller than my closet...The food was delicious; and the portion was gigantic. Everything was seasoned with so much spice and love; the lamb curry was pure ecstasy. I love how they grill their naan; slightly charcoaled and a crispy outer shell with a softer inside...The butter chicken was slightly dry; but the taste was good; and the sauce was pretty thick...The food are really cheap; but their flavours aren't cheap at all. The garam masala and the cumin powder stands out immediately when you take a bite into the lamb. The lentils and cauliflowers complemented the meat dishes wonderfully...You can bring your own wine and beer; which is extremely convenient for gatherings with families and friends.
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,9JV1GBwFLLAw8KpfaFETRg,5,It is another usual and typical Indian restaurant on Jean Talon Street. But as usual; it got the authentic feeling...The service was friendly and good. Everything was quick and efficient. ..We ordered pani puri as an appetizer. There were 8 pieces for 4$. It was so good that we wanted another platter; but we needed to save our space for our main dishes. My sister had her chicken biryani. Flavors and its aroma were filling up our nostrils. My sister enjoyed the dish very much; but it was a lot of food for one person. I think she ate 1/3 of it and the rest she took it for take out. I had the vegetarian Thali which includes naan; mixed vegetable curry; daal; paneer masala curry; cucumber/lettuce salad; rice and pakora... all this just for 10$. Every single item were very delicious. My tummy felt happy! ..Nice restaurant; good service and delicious food! Recommended!

Gigantic deep-fried dumplings filled with a more than generous filling of spiced potatoes; lentils and green peas. I'm not going to lie; I can make a meal out of these things; hit me up with three of four of those bad boys and a drank; and I can watch Men's Olympic water polo and hate myself into tomorrow.
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,P0J2H0XoJmcPzdwtJUHLcQ,SbGDnzEkyiPc9v6zP3QNfw,4,This is one of the best Indian restaurants in Montreal. The Naan and lamb curry dishes are very delicious and flavorful along with the chicken tandoori dishes.

Somebody else had recommended Saag; which I'd never tried before; but oh my goodness TRY THE SAAG!! It's revolting-looking; but one of the tastiest things I've ever tried. Plus the lamb is much more tender than chicken (butter chicken was delicious too; but I always find the chicken a little dry). ..And the samosas? 2 for $2 -- we had them with dinner and then took two more home with us! They are so flavourful; and even after sitting in the fridge and being re-heated the next day; they were still moist and delicious. That's impressive!..Naan is awesome; roganjosh was an interesting try (spicy!); we never had to wait for a table (although we came at 6:00 -- by 7:00 the place was packed); you can bring your own beer or wine... my *only* negative note is I didn't love their chai. For $2/cup I think I'd skip it and just focus on the deliciousness of saag :D
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,RZgoY-Z0NzpXA8PD-WcDOQ,Htw9Z0xXaN3Q6DjLL5jUFg,4,Consistently delicious. Tons of flavour and depth to their dishes. The best Indian resto on the block. Plus; it's bring your own beer and wine.

x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,YP5hNfCZruMdByn6Ah6XpQ,0NTKCqhUC-sxxjugyXWggg,5,The Punjab Palace is  my favorite Indian restaurant in Montreal (out of; say; the dozen or so that I've been to; including the more expensive Taj downtown).  I've probably eaten there more than any other restaurant in the city over the years but that probably says even more about their prices than it does their food (but not about its vicinity - it's a bit of a hike north and not too accessible to public transportation). It's not only bring your own wine (and beer); but it's pretty hard to get out of there spending more than 15 bucks per person with tax and tip (including appetizers; main course; nan; etc)...On the other hand; I'm not sure that I agree with the review below that claims the service is good. In fact; I'd say it's pretty bad. Come to think of it; it's just outright awful. I've waited twenty minutes just to get a menu (having to wildly flag down the server). Even when the places is half-empty; the service is still pretty bad. But if you factor the price in; you can accept it with zen-like serenity.  However; I'd advise that the restaurant is  not only bring your own wine but preferably bring your own wine opener too.  We started bringing ours because we struggled so many times to get the attention of the server to come over and open our bottles.  Once the bottles are open and alcohol is flowing; waiting is less frustrating. In fact; the last time we did that; our waiter ended up borrowing ours. Of course; he disappeared with it and then we had to hunt him down to get it back when we were ready for the next bottle...But enough about bottle openers. The Punjab has a fried fish appetizer (damn if I don't forget what it's called) that's spectacular. The only dud is the vindaloo which is not only not spicy but somewhat flavorless.  Everthing else is a winner.
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,jXHrSe9-iqyUa0sQGQtAOQ,ojsX6TNXAsxxpFxnf-HfEw,5,We've been going to Punjab Palace for about two years; sometimes weekly. My husband craves the street food of Mumbai; and in five years being abroad this restaurant has been the most authentic; dish after dish. Their appetizers are fantastic; and every curry we have had here has been on point for the Punjab style. The service can sometimes be slow; and weekend evenings can have a huge line; but it's so worth it. It's also BYOB; so take advantage as desired. We've tried every Indian place we could find in Montréal; and this place has the best food; and at a great price. If you love quality; I'd suggest getting individual curries; and don't bother with the Thali; where the same curries seem to lack the same level of care in the cook.

I ordered a ginger/lemon  chicken dish..could not discern any of the aforementioned flavours; but the dish was tasty nonetheless; the naan was good; not as good as in other places; rice; way too much; and chai  tea; ok; can't compare to Hesteas. Price for everything? Just under $20.00

We had garlic & plain naan (go with garlic!); butter chicken which was good but the meat came cubed and a bit weird and some red chicken dish that came sizzling in its plate (so good). We went with an Indian girl who knew her stuff so she can assert its authenticity! (Sorry I don't remember the names of our dishes)
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,5dCiti8ieP0QpdB3e03hLw,5CsV7CaFR9Jdn-5gTlchXQ,4,I love Punjab Palace! If they delivered I would have it much more often. Their butter chicken is perfect; the lamb curry too; their palao rice with spices; fried onions and green peas is the best around and their eggplant curry is my favorite. I've never tried their thaly dishes but they look great. The recent renovations have improved the look of the place; but when I was last there it looked like they had difficulties handlin the new influx of seated guests and the weird light wall in the back was pretty trippy; in a weird way. So you might want to call ahead and take out.

The food is really good and it is right in Little India. .So if you love to try some of the best and cheapest indian food in Montreal; all in a minute walk from each other; than this is the best place to come to..In the last 20 years or so that I've been spicing up my palate; I've tried about a dozen places in and around Montreal;  and I must admit that Jean-Talon is our version of Little India and a good one at that..After having tried many other ones; I keep coming back to this one. Not for their almost absent and clumsy service; nor for their barely audible music; nor for their badly heated seating near their huge windows facing the hustle and bustle of Jean-Talon street...but for their inexpensive and delicious and very well prepared indian food..LOVE their chicken tikka massala. .LOVE their very spicy chicken vindaloo..And many other ones that I've eaten but have forgotten the names...The place is quite busy but worth the wait.

x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,nzpp4ZGMz84iHilWpNk7zw,_nB4-T0J4JzjaPuBgUQviQ,4,Overall; very good food and service. Some of the dishes were a bit Asian tasting (chili paneer and ginger chicken) but food was fresh; tasty; and came out quick on a busy night. .Definitely a keeper for that area.
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,ZOpnys4tIjRx0rnNNHZ2Ag,MoDbD69B-tLoD41pLfAQYA,4,This is a delicious Indian cuisine. I recommend every should try the cuisine of the east
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,JXhciI81zieRI1ycwxoKbg,5,What we ordered:..Strawberry and Mango Lassi.Lamb Curry.Palak Paneer (Spinach and tofu).Chicken Tikka masala..My boyfriend and I visited on a Friday night. We got there at around 5:30pm; and had no trouble getting the table we wanted. That being said; the restaurant does get busy at around 6-6:30pm...The dishes were accompanied by their delicious Naan bread baked in their clay oven with a generous portion of seasoned white rice. We opted for the garlic Naan; which is very fluffy and pairs well with the sauce. Our food came out quickly and was warm and fresh. Everything was flavourful and rich. The Lamb curry; we were told; is their signature dish. It turned out to be my favourite. ..The portions offer great value for money. Their prices are inline with the other Punjab restaurants on Jean-Talon...The service was excellent. Our waiter was knowledgeable and helped us navigate the menu; which was helpful as my boyfriend was new to the cuisine. We were recommended the Lassis and it turned out to be a great suggestion.  They are a bit like a mix of milkshakes and smoothies but made with yogurt. ..Overall it was a great experience; and we had a great time. This is now one of our new favourites.
x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA,af_wcOBWx-EKYY1AqCj3Sg,hj7T2PNz7eTylkERAl1S5w,5,Excellent choice for tasty Indian food in Montreal at a reasonable price (quite inexpensive compared to others). Loved their paneer pakodas; chilli paneer; paneer tikka masala; naans & chole bhaturas.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,KOTGrktgJuwrYJ9oIKDyGg,ElI5n1Y_Hdj2m8F_GdFxng,4,Bem localizado; perto do metro; e das principais atrações turísticas; como a velha montreal onde vc não chega de metro só a pé. O quarto é grande e apesar de o café da manha não está incluso no pacote o café simples sem ser o continental (ovos e bacon) foi dado como cortesia .
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,JyHahe-ls4qauDm0To5Vag,ZDZZd75tQOv_AKvOJw5p2Q,3,Great location close to china town and a short walk to old town. The fun ended there. First we were not aware of $26 per day for parking. Second the curtains in the room did not close to block out any light. Found an old muffin in the closet. Really old; dried out. Lamp didn't work etc etc. Really disappointed for a hotel with good reviews and an advertised 4 star rating. It's a 2 star at best. The hotel staff did make things Right and the beds were really comfortable. I'd stay here again.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,_iX2q6GKxrYVrcGpEYwUWw,2HFbDjUqInl8HEdsaIX7LQ,4,Enjoyed my stay here last weekend. ..It's right in the middle ... 5 minutes from Old Montreal and then maybe 10-15 walk to St Catherines for shopping :P  ..Rooms are clean and the bathroom was quite big so it's nice if you had to share the mirror for make up because there is usually never enough room for two people ... but in this hotel you're in luck...I liked the concept of the lobby you can walk over to breakfast and dinner area over the water where the koi are swimming. ..We got a weekend special for $100 a night which included buffet breakfast.  I'm assuming they don't go these specials all the time so you have to keep an eye out for it. ..The only thing that bothered me was that the buffet in the morning was coldish..Eggs; sausage and bacon were hot ... almost on the verge of cold. .Other than that ... it was a pleasant stay...And yes parking is $20 additional.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,vnlr4GZ9BCB8t27eq-LZ3Q,_-bCvq9PYwB7cjxa5HSEXQ,2,The only good thing about this place was the free wifi which worked fast. It is also in a good central location to old Montreal and downtown. .Otherwise; our room was dark; dingy and smelled like smoke. There is a $27 parking free that isn't listed on their website or at least in a place that is easily seen. The room plus parking for one night was almost $200.. We have stayed elsewhere for less and had a much better experience.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,kTXhOFG15PPZnwppM-vP4w,xjwx8bUxYwOvD_YDmuJ8Cg,3,Good location; typical midrange hotel fair -- TERRIBLE WOMAN AT THE FRONT DESK...I am giving this hotel three stars because it doesn't deserve 1 or 2 stars as an institution. It is very beautiful inside; especially for a Holiday Inn; with an ongoing oriental theme (see large coi pond; etc.)..THE REASON IT WOULD GET 1 STAR FROM ME IS THE EVIL FRONT DESK ELF NAMED MAGDA. ..Not only does this woman have some kind of chip on her shoulder; but checking-in is like a passive aggressive competition of who can sound more like an arrogant b*tch in a race to prove that you are less intelligent about meaningless; bureaucratic hotel things. If you do check in here; MAKE SURE YOU WIN THE VERBAL BATTLE WITH MAGDA. ..I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A DISGUSTING ATTITUDE EVER WITH ANYONE (WITH A BRAIN) THAT WORKS IN HOSPITALITY. SHE GIVES MONTREAL A BAD REPUTATION; AND THAT'S SAYING A LOT.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,qWci4iV6W9F1efl9fXsiVA,ep1HueHUsDM4YTFotiQPJg,3,Stayed here for 2 nights with 2 girlfriends. Great location; only a short walk to the old district and another short walk to the bars (which was a focus for us girls on vacation together)...Rooms were adequate and clean and surprising quiet as there was a huge group of guys watching hockey in the room next to us and we never heard anything unless we were leaving the room and in the hallway. They had just changed over the mattresses on the floor so the mattress was nice and firm; rather than your usual holiday inn sagging...Foyer was interesting had that YMCA pool smell to it; but we later noticed that there was a huge fish pond in the ground. Weird; didnt think fish liked chlorine...We got a really really good rate (although parking is an additional $20 per night) and split between the 3 girls; meant we had extra money for spending on cocktails.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,FitYZkIiHRk9Pz7WYrf4AQ,LxcNdTJ5B_pYviNAeDJedg,4,This is our second stay at this Holiday Inn.  The rooms; hallways; and lobby area are very clean.  Staff is very polite.  The best part is the location.  Chinatown is right next to the hotel were there are lovely pastry shops and restaurants.  It is also walking distance to St. Catherine Street; Notre Dame Basilica and of course; Old Montreal.  It is the best location for any hotel it you want to visit Montreal.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,njDEUkpOrrmc66duSkaVng,whJItqUCeCUAGlq2jlt5lA,3,Comfy beds; seciruty is a little up tight kicking us out of the hallways; employees are not the brightest as i watched one walk face first into a door.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,3SfGMna0vjvrpy-jMT38gQ,VsXjHNJUWhOHyBGnFsajpg,4,The hotel was alright nothing crazy. The breakfast buffet can use some revamping on the menu. The valet service was remarkable. The location of this hotel is awesome. Nothing beat the convenience of walking to the metro (subway) and able to walk to the Old Montreal.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,u5gXJSdi0IysOH1G1ycKmw,sU2lLicVB0umXMTox2BusA,5,Perfect hotel for our first visit to Montreal. My only regret is only booking two nights and having to move to a lesser hotel my final night in the city. Using an online booking service (Priceline) I got a great rate on this hotel in the heart of the city. Parking is expensive at $28 (approx.) per day; but when you factor in the cost of moving around the city and trying to decipher the Francophone street signs; it was perfect to stay put and; plus; we had parking privileges the day of check-out until 6pm; so we were able to stay parked as we continued to explore (including an ill-fated attempt by the Mrs. to get this Southern man to try ice skating - I went fast just like Ricky Bobby...and then came my NASCAR-quality crash - thank god the flurries meant the rink was almost empty; and thank God the Zamboni closed the ice about 2 minutes later; but that's a different review I guess!). The parking lot was a little hard to find: tip; it's immediately to the left of the main entrance to the hotel as you face the building. That means it's on Rue Saint-Urbain BEFORE you get to the door of the hotel when coming from Rene-Levesque; which is how our GPS directed us. It's down a narrow entryway; but there's ample parking once you're in...The hotel has a Chinese flavor; as it is right next to the city's Chinatown. The staff had no problem communicating to me in English; and seemed like they might be Vietnamese; but I'm not sure. I salute them for having to speak at least 3 languages...The room was perfectly comfortable and clean. As a result of our online deal (I suspect) we were hustled off to a room on the 8th floor at the far end of the building far; far away from the elevator. Plus you have to switch elevators on the second floor to get to the parking garage. Plenty of French and English channels; plus a vending machine just down the hall. There is at least one Chinese restaurant in the building that claims to have the best Dim Sum in the city; but I did not try it. When entering the building from street level you have to go up a floor to get to reception. Kinda irritating; but minor...The most important thing here was the location. I love walking more than the Mrs.; and; being cheap; hate using Uber or taxi services. We were able to walk EVERYWHERE and see all we wanted to see. She didn't kill me either; although when she saw my plan to walk up a mountain on a frigid March day; I did wonder if a break-up was in my imminent future. As it happened; the walk to Mont Blanc was way easier than expected (but walking up? THAT's another story!!) and the view at the top was absolutely magnificent...Also; it's an easy walk to the Old Port (ok; if you're not a walker; check the distance in kilometers or miles and make sure you know what you're getting into) and to all the cute little touristy shops and beautiful buildings. I also loved walking through the business districts and seeing all this fabulous city has to offer...Better yet; the city is right next to the Place-d'Armes; a major Metro station reminiscent of Union Station here in DC. Plenty of eateries and; most importantly; a Tim Horton's right inside the door as you come in from the Holiday Inn. Despite being a DC resident for long enough now to be a sophisticated Metro rider; I was a little scared to try to ride the metro here with all the French names; but I'll try next time. Still; the principle is the same is in DC; look for your train by boarding the one with the name that is at the end of the line you are wanting to ride on; just make sure to get off at the right stop!..Bottom-line: If you can score a decent price; this is an excellent mid-range hotel that is an excellent base of operations for exploring the city with gusto - walk; metro; or drive; you will be set. I would absolutely try to return.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,4UiBpX_xzPi2dAX82IXezw,jxKO0m-LMoqBEGZy9jtYtQ,4,Definitely not bad for what we paid; about $100 per night including tax; and during Bal en Blanc weekend too. The positives: as close as you could possibly get to the subway (Place d'Armes Station); HOT water and lots of it; multilingual staff; clean rooms; in Chinatown; safe area; and a hop; skip; and jump away from Vieux Port. Negatives: Old room... it desperately needed a new dresser; no fridge; PACKED pool and jacuzzi (we tried to go twice without luck); weird smell of baby powder in our room for the first night; and expensive parking $26 a day??? We ended up parking in a complex just before the hotel and it cost us $18 for 3 days!
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,ps00_kAh92IMjXqTzxuHrw,10aknPhGKzBAneKNN_14jA,3,This is one of 3 Holiday Inns in the general Montreal area.  It is located on the edge of Chinatown but in an ideal location to walk to the Old Montreal area; or the Plateau section with the great restaurants; clubs; and bars.  Bars and clubs on Saint Catherine are also a short walk away.  ..Booking was easy and I was assured the rooms would be ready as I had requested (one with a roll-away bed and one without); both rooms next to each other.  My train was late getting into Montreal and we had to check in almost toward 9PM the day of.  Bianca at reception was friendly and for the most part helpful but by the evening it appeared the hotel staff gave all the rooms with double beds away and therefore had nothing for me left; even though I reserved weeks in advance.  They had to give me one room from another reservation coming in the next day and a room with one King size bed two floors up.  No apology and no compensation for these inconveniences.  We also had to wait two hours for the roll away and my friend wanted to take a nap before we went out for the night.  ..The second floor (which is the reception area; bar; and restaurant) has a nice in floor pond which you can walk through.  The rooms were decently sized.  One odd detail was that there were no ceiling lights; only lamps and the window.  ..A/C filter needed to be replaced and was actually done by hotel staff while we were trying to get dressed at 8AM one morning.  Housekeeping was good and took care of my requests.  ..Beds and showers were clean and everything but the television appeared new and was in working order.  ..Underground parking garage and taxi stand in front which is convenient for the airport or to head somewhere further.  Place d'Armes Metro station is across the street.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,BwpJ_b_cUX4XB71J4wm3qA,G2AGowO80ZvN6sDERUp1Tg,1,My friend booked this hotel for RNR Montreal as it was a partner hotel. I'm normally SPG all the way; but when my roommate fell through; I was happy to crash with a friend. The hotel is nicer than you might expect; but the location is a bit questionable... we saw matresses and other strange stuff on the street...My big ding is the SERVICE at the hotel or rather; the lack thereof. If you want to be a partner hotel to a race; then be a good partner. They were NOT. The race start was at 8:30; and when we asked for late checkout; we were told that no one running the race could have an extension; meaning; we would either need to not shower or shower elsewhere...Thankfully; a friend of mine who was staying elsewhere until the next day let me shower in his room. ..Also; no discount for parking at the hotel; even with validation...Rude staff. Stay elsewhere.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,9X_-mL2CgMIz5BXj3heMBw,2mDGijorfUt7ASaggudfNQ,4,My friend was the one who booked the stay here for us. When I heard we were during staying at the Holiday Inn my reaction was lol..k then?.  When we arrived I was pleasantly surprised. I don't frequent Holiday Inns; but the impression of a clear fish pond (although they should seek some advice on how to properly care for those fish as most of them seemed lethargic and sick. Not exactly a super pleasant sight) and relaxing atmosphere with stones and plants with a seating area. Staff was helpful and friendly although we did not interact with them for anything other than to check in/out and there were no issues. .Room was clean and nicer than expected. Comfy bed and pillows. Sheets; blankets; towels etc all seemed clean...room smelled clean. I assume this is post reno. However the pool and gym are lacking. The pool area smells like chlorine so its smells appropriate however appearances made me uneasy.  The pool is small and dirty. The hot tub is very dirty. Black gunk on tiles and black and brown gunk growing inside the filter intake and water jets...the warning sign enter at your own risk has a new meaning here. The gym was the tiniest I've ever seen... One treadmill? Just a bit awkward; but whatever...I didn't stay for the pool and gym anyway. Overall a pretty good place to crash.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,wOmQaom79yfS35EJH7CkGQ,dPP7UcCGD_iqeiqTbENRrg,1,In terms of the hotel itself; I found it to be great and would give you 5 stars if it had not been for the unacceptable behavior of one of your staff. On the last day of my stay; my experience was marred by the disrespectful treatment of one of your employees...On Monday July 14th; at 6am; I was waiting for my parents by the entry stairs. I had my luggage so I was clearly a patron at your hotel. I asked one of your young male employees where the restrooms were. I was told very rudely that I could go use the ones across the street and that I would have to wait outside. I informed him I was waiting for my parents. He then went into the vestibule and rudely told some Asian women that they'd have to go wait outside...Some Caucasian people then approached him with a question and I heard a different and courteous tone when he assisted them. ..I then asked him if there were restrooms on the 2nd floor and he reluctantly said yes. Why did he not tell me so in the first place? I felt discriminated against. I am paying for your hospitality; why should I have to go across the street to use the restrooms? I felt so humiliated and appalled that I did not think to ask for his name; which I regret. He is lucky I had to leave; otherwise I would have spoken to the manager about his racist attitude. His behavior was completely unacceptable; especially considering he is working in Chinatown.
XhZlS7LbbGXo675Q4r8nFw,vAhWqV8pSv3crEdTiaqFVw,-67wbiD2H8holbC7v3lVdg,5,I booked this hotel through a conference/meeting that I attended in the city - which had an applied discount. I chose this hotel because of it's location; right next to the convention center where the meeting was held. It was easy to find and located closely to Chinatown and Notre Dame..It is close to several restaurants and dining options and the walking distance from the meeting venue is literally crossing the street; which helps after long meeting days..The reception is on the second floor as the first floor is a little mall..The room was clean and offered all the amenities that you expect while in the city visiting for pleasure or business.
xJSnbW1xW3ea_FPS_rYoTQ,YP5hNfCZruMdByn6Ah6XpQ,WHt3q5_hlN2xesfagKmsLw,1,GONE! I think Pierre Trudeau (if that is his real name) hasn't been to Montreal in a while.  Ben's ceased being legendary or second to Schwartz's more than a decade ago. The restaurant's slow decline (food became worse and worse; restaurant dirtier and filthier) culminated in a worker strike over a year ago (protesting conditions as much as salaries); a pretext with which the widow who owned the restaurant used to close the place so she could sell the building (now slated for demolition to make way for a new office tower). I guess back in the day it was something but even the first time I ate there in 1999; it was a pale shadow of what it was.
xJSnbW1xW3ea_FPS_rYoTQ,VrMaL32wWNed_DjOcsO3Ng,EaU5coOr0yHPs-O2VPUjdA,4,World famous and likely most forgotten; old style Montreal Deli with the best smoked meat sandwich; corned beef and cabbage and cheesecake I have ever eaten. Miss it dearly!
xJSnbW1xW3ea_FPS_rYoTQ,mIysRk_cJ5K_BMZ-r06TFw,I1IUqoKE23Fm3jgnXyscEA,5,Second in the world of smoked meat sandwich delis only to Schwartz; Ben's is another legendary Montreal institution for which websites like Yelp exist. During the summer I spent at McGill; I came here way too often for my own good and would've gained 80 pounds if it weren't for the fact that I walked and rollerbladed everywhere in this most awesome of awesome cities.
Y2xUJHyWzHwuYg9_dxhJiw,qTcese4apYSlYZpSZyj6NA,FxfChThkJDo6QpgT1ppkHA,3,Its not great pizza at all but.... for airport standards its OK. You pick a pizza from behind the glass that already per-prepared princes range from $8-$10 and its ready really quick. Negative thing is you cant make any modifications to the pizzas. I had the bocconcini just for the fact that it had no sauce; because I'm very picky with sauce and it wasn't bad or great. They have a seating area and; for the price point and location its alright.
Y2xUJHyWzHwuYg9_dxhJiw,LjVSiTyvInBrr21rxL1GBQ,COncaF9ATvBheHvc-2UvFA,4,The food options at YUL have improved significantly over the last year and YUL Pizza is definitely a highlight. ..They have 17 different kinds of pizza including at least five vegetarian options - a rare find here! And while they're pre-assembled for display; they cook them to order and they taste delicious! Everything is quick and there's never much of a line. They'll do it to go for you or you can eat in their cosy seating area. ..And then there are the mini cupcakes! So good. A great way to finish off your meal here!
Y2xUJHyWzHwuYg9_dxhJiw,vzr-pMYMJehB3nqtzbJ3bA,9Zp4o4XgV1ziPb_cVEtmDg,3,Ordered Bbq chicken; it was just alright. .Up side: pizza was ready in 2 mins. Weird.
Y9UvlMorn7G4mxzwN5QpsQ,4jbz7cOVuV_Q7v2b3pNrLw,ZLHXI-OUY0rMgNOA2UNYgw,2,I wasn't too impressed with the food. It was okay but I've definitely had better Korean. I had the bento box and only liked a few items.
Y9UvlMorn7G4mxzwN5QpsQ,z-X5xf1gJBlgEumUhqv3aw,ok294b4df1oTzJ7y34qzlg,5,If you're going to go; get the bibimbap; it's amazing. Been back multiple times and it's such a cute little treasure.
Y9UvlMorn7G4mxzwN5QpsQ,diX1YW2NhhoN-jLPnaYCdg,9d9-AS5UNrU0-7O1Owgl4Q,3,Been eating here for 8 years and have seen the portions get smaller. The miso used to have tofu and seaweed; now half a bowl of powder soup. The chicken katsu box only has a slice of yam cut in three pieces; salad is just leafs of kale ; used to have onions and carrots. No more mushrooms either.  I still come here though as it's only resto on my street..It would be nice if owner asked once in a while if i enjoyed meal.
z8PVT4jvn-Boc4CavDH1ww,tFWmPlHc1z0Maq4RWL8sDg,7dk3q8Fb54K3zDf_jLgmlg,1,Terrible; terrible food! I had a craving for Tom Yum soup and I had been meaning to try this place. I knew i was in for a bad experience when I walked in and saw that the place was huge but completely empty. 0 customers. The staff acted as if they were confused as to why a stranger would walk in the door and start asking for food...I had Tom Yum Soup and Sesame Chicken. I have had much better Tom Yum out of a can. The sesame chicken was worse than what you would get at Tiki Ming 5 minutes before closing...Will never go back.
z8PVT4jvn-Boc4CavDH1ww,HmYj8wXXzzmc80DIenufuw,sdLnEh1TSXV9uQGclxceaw,2,I was here in 2006 and starving. It was meh. Not amazing; not delicious; but it hit the spot...Then again; I was really ravenous.... and craving Pad Thai...I found the portions reasonably sized and for $10; it was a decent price. ..I haven't been back since; but that's because I haven't had a craving for Thai in a while.
zr_bmtM-SBIKKp2feKMWXw,bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,VpPJWGigU9cwJFYuQYxiqA,3,At first glance I thought to myself why doesn't this place have more than 3 stars; and then I reflected on my experience and I now concur...I mean the flavor of my Shitaki burger  (really nuggets of some kind of chopped Shitake blend) was above average in the taste department. The beet slaw and faux mayo were quite a nice compliment on a sesame seeded bun; however the size of said burger was not so fulfilling. ..For the price you think you might be more satiated - at least I didn't go to bed on a full stomach - filled with heavier foods like other nights. Will change that habit (good inner monologue); but not a subject for this review.   ..A huge disappoint was the Chai almond latte; more for the fact that it was $4.99 for a small cup of liquid that had an odd spice blend. Meaning it had neither a good Chai or Indian spiced tea taste. I figure the almond milk over whelmed the situation - or probably the price shocked my taste buds - what is this a high end tea shop or a drink at a vegan restaurant that is just over priced. Help more people become vegan. Start with welcoming prices; but again see below - I'm a newbie...Other notes: The lemon water and clean bathroom were nice touches. The Jalapeno and Habanero hot sauces don't really fit the taste profile of what I would like to accent my vegan; but maybe I'm just a newbie.
zr_bmtM-SBIKKp2feKMWXw,XZfv70IsujPrIMGKeL9kdw,emSG1LEdf6hXCcOQMdIpOw,4,I'd read mixed reviews of Copper Branch but I had a great experience at their restaurant on Ste-Catherine near Atwater (I've been told to avoid the one in the Alexis Nihon food court). Pricey but yummy. I had a vegetable sandwich - loved the caramelised onions and 'cheese'; and my omnivore boyfriend had the poutine and a mushroom burger. The poutine wasn't great in his opinion but the burger was good. I'm very glad that Montreal has its own vegan fast food chain and if I lived in the city; I'd be back for sure.
zr_bmtM-SBIKKp2feKMWXw,g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,3Owx0YnWbWpDT4b2XNjQ2w,3,I'm a fan of copper branch. This is my first visit to a second location of copper branch. My usual location- being dix30.  I liked the central location - as a healthier alternative to a movie night meal at the forum. It was clean and we'll maintained . The menu seemed to have more variety than the south shore location- burgers; sandwiches; poutine; etc. For salad bowls - you have to choose your theme (Mediterranean; Aztec; Asian fusion; Aristotle); choice of base of grain and protein. I decided to go with the Aztec Mini bowl (8$ vs 12$ w/o tax) with Konjac noodles and teriyaki Shitake mushrooms. Perfect portion to fill me up ladies! Unless you want leftovers to take home. .The only downer - the water dispenser took 6 mins to fill up my glass! For a franchise I'm sure they can afford to purchase a fountain machine or provide the complimentary tap water to the customers themselves!
zr_bmtM-SBIKKp2feKMWXw,5HiO4RFBVtAc7EY6w2mmRg,m55uZAoIyOL7P9xjgaARjA,3,The worst vegan food. Its like vegan fast food. I tried to eat twice at copper branch; and i wasnt impressed. I have tried a lot of vegan food in Mtl; and i was really disappointed. The prices are kind of unrealistic for what you get. The fries of the poutine were cold the sauce was sticky and cold and you get like 10 fries for 9$.
zr_bmtM-SBIKKp2feKMWXw,Gdyzk0Bq4CMsp8onOsdsdA,eckWrAj30lULPDYJ4YJoKA,1,You'd think a joint specialized in serving vegetables would know how to properly prepare greens. But when I took a bite out of my lukewarm portobello cabbage wrap; my teeth screeched on some sand. Yeah you read it right
zr_bmtM-SBIKKp2feKMWXw,JAmxtERE0z7AMFJ8UIkKjA,KhEzzdFgG6Wws2dCXYbTow,3,This place was pretty good. The black bean burger was awesome! Gotta get it with the cheese and avocado. What's for sure is that the portion sizes are out of control here! So many fries and so much salad. Makes me wish the burger was bigger lol. I thought the fries were a little over seasoned. The workers were nice; but they must have been short on staff because the tables had fresh stains and someone's trash got moved around to the table behind us. Some almost spilled on my wife when some guy knocked over a coffee cup. Needs to be a little more cleanly; but the food was good. Just prepare for a lot!
zr_bmtM-SBIKKp2feKMWXw,nZUsDCm1v1tSJVWJHFEflg,vA_RDfG6XE3R_ovcsTw90w,3,First of all; don't make the clumsy mistake of promising to meet up at a Copper Branch and mess up the location. There are quite a few in Montreal (my friend and I didn't know that) so we almost star-crossed. Proceeding ..Copper branch is your fast-food vegan place. My friend ordered a mushroom burger and matcha latte (she is not vegetarian nor vegan); and I ordered a cheesecake (I'm vegetarian but I try my best to have vegan food when possible). My friend freaking loved her burger AND her drink; and was constantly intrigued by what's in the food because it's SO good! It was her first vegan meal; so she was evidently very excited. I tried her burger too and indeed it was good; especially the sauce! I'd recommend that burger (though I don't remember the exact name of it). The cheesecake was great too by the way; but it was served in the fridge next to the counter; which was a little disappointing. But that's because I expected this place to be less fast-food-like. I was not used to having vegan fast food...Speaking of which; my friend and I thought vegan fast food was a great thing to have. It's convenient for eat-ins and take-outs; and pretty fast and serving good; vegan food. The prices were not so high either. I would totally come grab a bite when I'm hungry at university (Concordia); I could walk there and also take a short walk break because it's not SUPER nearby. ..CONS: The cashier couldn't speak English. I can speak a little French; enough to sort of communicate (and I'm also a master of body language); so it was okay; but I didn't expect that happening at all. The table was also really dirty; it wasn't cleaned before us. I had to get a napkin to clean it up myself. I don't really mind that personally; but some of you might've minded that. But again; y'know; it's a fast food place. ..Copper Branch is a great place to grab a vegan bite; I really like the idea of it and I will definitely visit again!
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,YS6Ew5Yj2YL0P-84U4Lsog,zg7giIvyHkuVkerAgK9kQA,1,Eggspectations does a great job of luring you in.  You're still groggy from a night of Montreal festivities; you search on your phone for breakfast or maybe ask the hotel front desk where to go for breakfast; and you wind up here; in a kinda cool/trendy decorated space...Then you notice the LINE.  And the host (once they finally notice you in the back of the line after 5 minutes) tells you the wait right now is about 45 min to an hour.  So you think 'Hmm well if all these people are here to wait in line then this place MUST be great!' ..And that; dear readers; is the logical; yet incorrect assumption.  Because what you don't realize that this place is basically the first stop for hoards of tourists who were directed (like yourself) to this very mediocre eating establishment; and now that all of you are finally here; and waiting in line; you say to yourself; people wait hours for amazing food in the metropolitan city where i'm from; this must be one of those places.  The other problem is the tourists in Montreal generally come in packs; so there's a lot of underage college/high school kids in groups of 6-10 who will be fighting you for tables.   ..One of the problems is the service is incredibly slow.  I watched the host/hostess bussing tables and even getting sucked into taking orders while the line kept piling up and nobody was bringing order to the chaos; while empty tables weren't even being used.  The other problem is their waiter/waitress ratio for the size of the restaurant is totally out of whack.  Eggspectations are pretty big; maybe 40-50 tables and 2 stories; and on several occasions I've been here each waiter/waitress is trying to handle something like 10-15 tables...If the food were out of this world I might overlook these shortcomings; but really; it's very mediocre diner food; on par with Denny's or IHOP; (which has much better service).  For a local alternative; do yourself a favor and walk to Olive et Gourmando for a proper breakfast.  Seriously people; you're in the closest thing to Europe (with all its amazing bakeries and cullinary choices) in North America- there are much better dining options than this tourist trap.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,NdSNQXoxiFeNZQ1M6uB9fA,uOu1xoqb-PPshQfA9lyPzw,1,We were walking around Montreal starving on Saturday morning and passed this place. It seemed pretty busy- there was a few people waiting for tables- so we decided to give it a try. We waited about 15 minutes for a table. No one was coordinating who was being seated when; there was nobody to ask about wait time; and there was no actual line. So we kind of just milled about in the front of the restaurant until someone pointed at us and told us to follow them...Our waiter was really; really slow. Eventually; we ordered. I ordered iced tea; and they charged me by the glass without mentioning it first. My friends ordered coffee; and every time they needed a refill; it took us 15 minutes to wave down our waiter and ask for more coffee. I ordered a bacon and cheese burger with fries. It arrived cold; without bacon. My friends both ordered eggs benedict; and their eggs arrived hard; and not runny at all. However; they said it was still good- but also cold. We could have asked our waiter to warm up our food- a table next to us asked him to warm theirs up- but we were so hungry and sick of waiting that we just decided to eat it...When we finished the meal; it took forever to get our waiter to bring us our check; pay; and leave. The food was average to below-average; the service was horrible; and the meal took forever (about 1.5 hours). Not a good combination!
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,RkQh-_1Hfth38wt0wJRoJA,Wmlf-2LZX_WBsADo8RhbFA,2,I hadn't been to Eggspectation in at least 6 or 7 years and decided to have breakfast there while visiting Montreal. The quality has gone downhill and I was disappointed in my meal. I had the Oy Vegg and what was supposed to be latkes were three overly deep fried hockey puck like pieces of potato. It came with decent scrambled eggs and two tiny pieces of fruit. The service was okay; and the coffee was not much better than diner coffee . Overall I would say it was eggspecterrible.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,Ol6V3-kgp0-Og9LKaud9sg,dThoFfSf7heUdZUeXlvfYQ,1,The reputation this place has as a tourist trap isn't exactly getting help from the kind of service I had today.  After delivering coffee; the server disappeared for more than 20 minutes - he never took my order.  He wasn't busy; he was at the cash; chatting with the only other server.  Unless you're stuck in Old Mtl. with nowhere else to eat at 7am; head for the nearest Chez Cora instead.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,EeI4yjrvQi_H_q-5CXjUfg,h5_FpplJrI0nsOSrEOI0sg,4,I ate at the one on St Catherine by the jazz festival; but it's not listed on here; so I shall review here.  ..I know it's a chain as a poster below mentioned; but still; if someone asked me my fav rest in NYC; I would probably say Nobu; even though it has about 15 locations.  Or maybe even Striphouse; which has a bunch too.  Shake Shack has 3 in NYC..So if you can give me a weekend where I have eggspectations for breakfast; shake shack for lunch; and nobu for dinner....(maybe even late night at Wendy's); I don't think I could really complain too much.....Although...when I saw their menu and their locations...Montreal; OK; Toronto; OK; and then two totally f$@#ing random spots in Maine and Maryland?? Seriously?  why not New York if you want to expand?  I'd say Hoboken too; but I'll still order Turning Point any day over eggspectations..Enough about that; the service was great (what can I say; I love cute French-Canadian chicks); the prices are cheap; and the food is fantastic.  And....they have lil packages of peanut butter at the table..don't judge; but i threw some in my bag for later.....I had an omlette with cheese and jalepenos which was spicy and really good...the potatoes and toast too.....My chick had a breakfast burger; and although Ive never had lettuce and tomato on a hambuger bun with eggs; it really was good...don't mock it till you try it...orange juice was fresh squeezed too.  There were about 25 more things on the menu i really wanted to try..too bad i only went there once during my trip..well...i guess I can always take a road trip to Maryland one of these days..
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,CXKptjJG5g0qhreV3I3RYA,S8RnCXpD9c7AdZwHOX59Ow,3,i had corn beef hash with eggs. it wasn't fresh corn beef hash; boo. it was nice late brunch with the girls and hit the spot. really good toast and good smoothies. the restaurant was super close to our hotel; embassy suites.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,KCbUGaXWnclrQ51RS_hOXw,2,I suspected this was a chain.  And i should have went screaming in the other direction instead of having breakfast here.  But hadn't really checked out the area by the hotel yet; and when you are starving for breakfast you'll make crazy choices.  ..I ordered the bagel and smoked salmon.  Bagel was barely toasted; the salmon barely smoked and the three capers they put on the plate; not nearly enough.  And when I found out the price was really $13.95 and not $9.95 as printed in the english menu; pretty much decided never to darken their door again.  The other bad thing wasn't what happened with my poor over priced food and outdated menu; but the table next to me were two poor brits who just never go the right food.  The whole time the waitress was messing things up the manager was sitting enjoying his coffee chatting with the line cook.  ..Plenty of other better choices in the area; don't be like me and settle for the first thing you see!
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,PhWW6RCfPxgOMmVqP2kizw,xumZJR1NW0qmTeNRniS4lw,3,The place is pretty impressive from the onset as the decor is slick.  I went twice with my family on a recent Montreal weekend.  The first day the service was awesome and the family was delighted with their breakfast.  Unfortunately; I found a hair in my eggs benedict halfway through breakfast.  I didn't bring this to anyones attention as the rest of my family was raving about the food and I didn't want to ruin the experience for them.  ..The second day we were seated upstairs and waited too long for a server.  When Carlos finally graced us with our service he was a total prick.  He was unfriendly and my wife and I were both of the opinion that he didn't want to serve us.  We had to wait far too long for our food and he didn't ask the perfunctory question; Can I re-fill your coffee?.This guy knocked a full star off my yelp rating...I hate to be negative so I'll finish by saying that the food was quite good and that chances are you won't get stuck with Carlos.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,u0LXt3Uea_GidxRW1xcsfg,y21Fom8a_SdAyC6I0v554w,2,a few years ago; this used to be the place to be for bunch. I was really excited to take my boyfriend here to experience one of the must visit places in MTL. Boy were we disappointed!..We had ordered the eggspectation omelette and eggs benedict. The omelette was bland; overcooked. The eggs benedict were ok; but I've had better. The portion size has come down...Overall; food and service has gone downhill and not worth my time anymore.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,Kchj2U3yTo1hOZoiOkcErA,ix65Yw66j1WJgVIDaVEVew,4,My great eggpectations were readily met by Eggspectation; a welcome change from the hotel breakfast routine that we experienced during our first morning in Montreal...On morning two I pledged to do better and so ; having researched yelp montreal; crossed Place D'Armes and made my way to an establishment that could just as easily be called Place D'Eggs (Des Oeufs)...The breakfast menu is very eggs-tensive but also includes pancakes; waffles; crepes; bagels and more...I was immediately drawn to the bagel with smoked salmon and scrambled eggs. (On the side; thank you). Given my voracious breakfast appetite I thought I'd also order a brioche...What arrived was by far the mother of all brioches and could have been shared by two people. ..I wasn't too much a fan of the fact that the bagel came atop a bed of lettuce but I gladly overlooked the green when I bit into the doughy sesame goodness...The scrambled eggs were also tasty; unlike the hotel's they were not rubbery; resembling chopped up dish washing gloves...To reiterate; great eggs and they know how to use them.....(Given that the restaurant's name is a pun I had to indulge)...On day 3 we returned and I tried the waffles with bananas and powdered sugar. Once again; great food at great prices. The only reason I detract the 5 star rating is that service was slow on both occasions...Sunday's tardiness I could understand as the place was swarming with guests but on Monday the place was much emptier. Slow service did not at all detract from the overall experience as the food surpassed my expectations...Finally; the decor is far better than the typical IHOP-- exposed brick; visible kitchen where you can look and listen to the sounds and sights of food preparation and tastefully positioned eggs and egg themed art.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,d3kEhf6hmEFmZsGmE-IXUg,RHu0DtI9Wpe0xITwdU2K-Q,2,Overall the food is fine; but not a satisfying value given that I don't eat much bread; fried potatoes... ..At a glance; the variety and selection are fairly impressive but that's where the delight ends.  Most of the dishes come with a side of fresh fruit.  They make white bread that is fresh; thick and fluffy...    ..Getting seated took a while.  After our food arrived; it took some effort to let our server know when we wanted something further.  ..I ordered corned beef hash w/ eggs; naturally and I was disappointed with the meat portion and quality.  It's basically hash from a can with lots of little tiny bits of potato; in a flattish 2.5 x 2.5 patch; surrounded by starchy fillers like bread and potatoes.  I've had much much better with nice tasty chunks of beef; less potato and a generous plateful for less than $7 at Pamela's in Pittsburgh.  ..My husband ordered a side of baked beans and he got these in a little plastic cup roughly the size that you taste samples in at the grocery store.....Of course you can customize your meal with sides.  Extra Hollandaise sauce is as is typically the case in Montreal available for a supplement.  ..Note also that they have a bar and alcoholic beverages are served here; but the hours are quirky so check before going...I will probably be back but I am in no hurry.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,DBYER6mByzmctGOt0bfkFQ,ulZz7aiKefRS6M5Tq8W2Xg,3,Went here because it's right around the corner from our hotel (Intercontinental).  I've been to the MA location many years ago and remembered loving it.  This time was just OK.  When you enter the door you notice the nice decor; but then you're left standing there for minutes before anyone acknowledges you.  When we were finally seated it took many minutes to get a waitresses' attention to order and another lengthy wait to finally get our food.  The food itself is actually pretty good.  It's too bad the service sucks.  When we were done it took forever to get the check.  ....and then like a bunch of dummies we went back again the next day for breakfast and had the same exact experience.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,-hKniZN2OdshWLHYuj21jQ,oZz7Z_Z5t_A-koMT19l-ig,4,Yum Yum!! First; I love breakfast.  Second; it's often very hard for me to find a good breakfast place while traveling...Eggspectations is decorated in lots of fun egg art and the staff is friendly and prompt.  The menu has more options for Eggs Benedict that I have ever seen before. Hubby had a bagel version that was pretty good.  For me; the Eggstravaganza was awesome!!..On top of the great good; the juice I ordered was certainly fresh squeezed and delicious!!..If you're in town make sure you stop by so that you can get a great breakfast in Montreal.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,1uys55OaSi9WMZyP-N_CSw,V0nDWyedlw1CNMj2MRa1cg,2,This place is incredibly convenient for me from a location perspective; but as many of the other reviewers state; terribly inconvenient for me from a time perspective...The food is good; the fresh-squeezed juices fab; and the espresso packs a good punch...The service leaves a *lot* to be desired; though.  Take-away in particular is a hassle; where I'm usually forced to find someone and *BEG* them to take and swipe my credit card because I; unlike all the other languidly lunching customers; just can't spend 2 hours while the overstretched staff sort things out.  Actually...stand by the bar under the stairs; and you'll get an even better idea of how confused this place really runs...Go if you have time.  A lot of it.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,u1_OF0lkoU274x6yhsXIyQ,rW77YNPTu4QQZN5LICfyrw,2,I will admit I am not overly creative when it comes to this restaurant as i always order eggs benedict.  I do try the different types of eggs benedict though; and today it was salmon.  food is as good as usual; but I need to say the service sucked this morning.  it took 10-15 min before I even had coffee in my cup.  Then i had a meeting at 9am; figured asking for the bill at 8:25 would do it; but with only 15 min left to get to my meeting I brought my credit card up to the front to pay.   A bit disappointing...Takes Amex.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,cBIkLz-J_qyKAtFCZy9dUw,I2xvQBwmqfaTV6WCwiX1MQ,3,Torn between the eggs Benedict (my staple breakfast dish) and their eggs on yolk; which I felt immediately drawn to. Went for the latter. The egg on a yolk had an unusual presentation. The bagel sides were turned upside down  with egg on the bottom and about 3 slices of bacon with cheese on top. The bagel was a Montreal bagel so of course I loved it.  I feel like I didn't need all that bacon. The meal also came with a side of fried potato which I didn't care for; and some fresh fruits. ..The service here was practically nonexistent. It took our waiter a while to get to our table even though the place was quite empty at 7am. Never checked up on us. And; we had to hunt him down for our check. I'm just happy that I tasted my Montreal bagel...3 stars for the food.0 star for service
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,kLm3B6LeboEZWX_4otpILA,SPKJp_g_voabQyT1TK7tWg,2,One of the few times I've completely thrown away food. Got a chicken and mushroom crepe and it was absolutely disgusting. Wife got an egg sandwich and it was raw at first then they had them recook it. Best part of it all was the juice and the potatoes. On top of the terrible food; they charge insane prices. Those two things cost $35 after tip. Our server was nice; that was another plus. This place serves bad food and I won't come back here again.
zxJlg4XCHNoFy78WZPv89w,8V6klkcahF59lBHCA-MnhQ,njEbxRIpUgP0hltLNHWGVA,4,One things we noticed when we booked our recent summer stay at L'Hotel (formerly the 19th Century Hotel) was that online reviewers listed the hotel's proximity to Eggspectations as a bonus.  So of course we had to check Eggspectations out.  The food's pretty delicious!  We dined here twice - the 1st time I ordered the savory Oy Vegg (latkes; eggs; grilled tomatoes & sour cream; came w/ fruit & toast). The second time I got a tasty Bagel Dore (bagel dipped in egg whites & cooked; served w/ fruit; yogurt & honey).   (Though as New Yorkers; we love & laud OUR bagels; we had to try the famed bagels in Montreal a few times - yes they are good!  Different from ours in NY; more bread-like w/ a bit of sweetness?  Though NYC bagels still have my heart... ).  Great coffee here!  Dug the cool interior - exposed brick; paintings; etc... ..Admittedly; I saved our least-favorite aspect for last - the SERVICE.  During our first visit; we were practically ignored for the initial few minutes we were in this restaurant; then once seated; ignored a while longer (it wasn't that busy).  Our waitress was - well; not UNfriendly; but kind of... void.  (The waiter who had seated us & got us menus was a bit more cordial).  We witnessed a table complain about cold food twice; the waitress didn't really handle the situation well (got the food; returned it microwaved & did everything mechanically; with no apologies or reassurances); the table eventually left without eating.  On our SECOND visit; however; we got much better service - friendly & attentive.  So just know that the service here might be inconsistent but the breakfast food at this chain was tasty enough for us to return & for me to give it 4 stars.
